# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_drivers.in

# A multilevel parallel study with concurrency in analysis drivers.
# For one level of parallelism (1 evaluation_server, serial analyses),
# running on 3 processors is a good choice.  For two levels of
# parallelism (1 evaluation_server, 2 processors_per_analysis), a total
# of 6 processors works well.  And for three levels of parallelism,
# 13, 19, 31, or 54 processors could be used for 2, 3, 5, or 9
# evaluation_servers, where 13/19/31 use self-scheduling at the
# iterator level and 54 uses static scheduling at the iterator level.

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# This tester fills out a test matrix of direct/fork/system interfaces
# vs. synch/asynch local/message passing/hybrid modes.  For serial
# executions (tests 0-6), the 4 combinations of synch/asynch
# evaluations/analyses are tested for each of the interfaces for which
# the combinations are supported.  For parallel executions, the direct
# interface is tested in message-passing mode in tests p0-p2, the fork
# interface is tested in message-passing mode in tests p3-p4 and in
# hybrid mode in tests p5-p7, and the system interface is tested in
# message-passing mode in tests p8-p9 and in hybrid mode in test p10.

# Processor specification for automated parallel tests:
# p0=3, p1=6, p2=6, p3=3, p4=6, p5=2, p6=4, p7=2, p8=3, p9=6, p10=2
