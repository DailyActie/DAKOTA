# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_rosenbrock_importance.in
# This file tests the importance sampling capabilities based on LHS. 
# It is may be integrated into another rosenbrock file but for now 
# it is cleanest to have a simple, standalone file. 
# Note the idea is that the 50 sample probability of failure 
# with standard normal inputs and a response level of 3 is 0.1, 
# but the "true" probability of failure is 0.0675, which is 
# what we are trying to attain with the importance sampling.
