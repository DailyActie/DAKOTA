# DAKOTA Input File: dakota_uq_cantilever_taylor2.in

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# This file covers second-order reliability index approach (RIA) CDF
# mappings from response_levels to probability_levels and second-order
# performance measure approach (PMA) CDF mappings from these
# probability_levels back to the original response_levels for MVSOSM,
# x-/u-space AMV^2, x-/u-space AMV^2+, x-/u-space TANA, and SORM.
