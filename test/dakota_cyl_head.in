# DAKOTA INPUT FILE : dakota_cyl_head.in

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# This file covers a testing matrix in which NPSOL, DOT, CONMIN, and OPT++
# each solve the cyl_head problem with 5 different formulations:
# (1) minimization w/ 3 nonlinear 1-sided ineq
# (2) minimization w/ 3 nonlinear 1-sided ineq plus 1 linear 1-sided ineq
# (3) minimization w/ 3 nonlinear 1-sided ineq plus 1 linear eq
# (4) minimization w/ 2 nonlinear 2-sided ineq plus 1 nonlinear eq
# (5) maximization w/ 3 nonlinear 1-sided ineq (non-default bounds)
