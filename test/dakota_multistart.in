# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_multistart.in

# Demonstrates the use of the multi_start strategy for a
# multimodal test problem.  The global optimum is at the
# point (x1,x2) = (0.177,0.177) which has a function value
# of 0.060.

# Parallel test matrix is dedicated master and peer partition
# scheduling for concurrent iterators with single-processor and
# multiprocessor iterator partitions.

# Processor specification for automated parallel tests:
# p0=3, p1=3
