# DAKOTA INPUT FILE - dakota_multiobj2.in

# Each DAKOTA test file is capable of running multiple tests. The
# manual process for doing this is to add or uncomment specific lines
# needed for a test and comment out other lines which are not needed
# for that specific test.  Within the automatic test script, a special
# syntax is used to automatically determine which lines are to be used
# for a specific test. A #n (0 - 9) is used to associate lines in the
# test file with a specific test.  The #0 is used to designate lines
# which are to be run as part of the baseline test but not part of the
# other tests. To add multiple tests to a file add the #n to the
# trailing comment of a line, the dakota_test script will parse
# through the file uncommenting the lines marked for a specific test,
# and commenting out unneeded lines marked with the #0. Specific lines
# can be included in multiple tests by adding multiple #n designaters
# seperated by a comma.

# Constrained multiobjective optimization using the Cylinder Head problem.
#
# The formulation is: minimize F
#                     s.t. x_l <= x <= x_u
#                          g1(x) <= 0
#
# where F  = w1*f1 + w2*f2 + w3*f3
#       f1 = original cyl_head objective fcn
#       f2 = original cyl_head constraint 1
#       f3 = original cyl_head constraint 2
#       g1 = original cyl_head constraint 3
