This directory contains all the code for running the Tank problem,
used in the 2014 V&V Challenge Workshop at the ASME V&V Symposium.

There are usage notes within the individual files. More details and
the context of the workshop are available online at: https://share.sandia.gov/vvcw
This site will continue to operate until at least FY15.

To test that the code is running properly, type
  python EvalTank.py SampleInputToEvalTankpy SampleSummaryFile SampleDataFile
or
  EvalTank.py SampleInputToEvalTankpy SampleSummaryFile SampleDataFile
The second option requires that EvalTank.py be executable.

Because of the selected resultStyle, only SampleSummaryFile will be written.
The SampleDataFile will only be written if resultStyle is 1.
