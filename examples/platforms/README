This directory (platform/) contains platform-specific information for
building, installing, and running DAKOTA.  

-------------
INSTALL files
-------------

Files INSTALL.* contain general guidance for configuring, installing,
and initially running DAKOTA on various platforms.  Information in
these files is not specific to a machine, but rather to specific
operating systems.


--------------
Config scripts
--------------

Scripts config.* contain example invocations of the Dakota configure
script on various specific platforms.  These scripts may not always be
kept up to date with Dakota, nor with individual operating
system/platform settings.

Naming conventions:  When posible, each script should be named 
  OS_options_platform
or
  OS_options
where platform is included when the configure is for a particular
target platform; OS includes 32 or 64 bit; and one or more options,
separated by underscores, include items such as mpi, packages
included/excluded, debug/optimization.

The script body should include comments detailing
- platform (if unique to a particular machine)
- operating systems tested on
- options included 
- date last tested and with which versions of Dakota and packages
  (acro, DDACE, OPTPP, surfpack)

Scripts should be portable, i.e., independent of the particular shell
in use when invoked.  To invoke a configure script, cd to the dakota
top level directory Dakota/ and use

  sh ./platform/config.MYPLATFORM

where sh is your preferred shell executable.
