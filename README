Overview

The DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) 
toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface between analysis codes and 
iteration methods. DAKOTA contains algorithms for optimization with gradient 
and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, 
reliability, stochastic expansion, and epistemic methods; parameter estimation 
with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensitivity/variance analysis with 
design of experiments and parameter study capabilities.  These capabilities 
may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as 
surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or 
optimization under uncertainty.

Refer to http://dakota.sandia.gov/ for additional information,
including support contacts.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distributions

DAKOTA is distributed in binary (executable/library) and source code
formats.  Recommendations for getting started with either format can
be found in INSTALL included with the distribution, but the most up to
date guidance can be found alongside downloads on the DAKOTA website.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Platforms

DAKOTA operates on most systems running Unix or Linux operating
systems as well as on Windows with the help of a Cygwin
emulation layer.  DAKOTA is developed and most extensively tested on
Redhat Enterprise Linux with GNU compilers, but additional operating
systems / compiler combinations are tested nightly as well.  See the
DAKOTA website for more information on supported platforms for
particular DAKOTA versions.  DAKOTA was historically tested on
SGI/IRIX, DEC/OSF, and HP-UX, but these are not actively supported.
