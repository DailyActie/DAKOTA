Overview.

The DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale Applications) 
toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface between analysis codes and 
iteration methods. DAKOTA contains algorithms for optimization with gradient 
and nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling, 
reliability, stochastic expansion, and epistemic methods; parameter estimation 
with nonlinear least squares methods; and sensitivity/variance analysis with 
design of experiments and parameter study capabilities.  These capabilities 
may be used on their own or as components within advanced strategies such as 
surrogate-based optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or 
optimization under uncertainty.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Distribution.

The directories contained in DAKOTA distributions include (bin denotes
binary distributions, src denotes source distributions):

bin		    Binary files for DAKOTA, restart utility, dprepro, and 
(bin)		    various third-party libraries (TPLs).

examples            Example problems from the Users Manual, examples of
(bin/src)           interfacing with other codes using script-based or direct
		    linkage-based interfaces, parallel computing examples, and
		    platform installation examples.

test                Files for regression and unit testing of the DAKOTA system.
(bin/src)           Test simulator programs and DAKOTA input files are
                    provided for testing different capabilities.

include (bin)	    Include files for DAKOTA and it's associated TPLs.

lib (bin)	    Library files for DAKOTA and it's associated TPLs.

share (bin)	    Miscellaneous files installed by DAKOTA TPLs.

packages            Libraries of iterative algorithms provided by commercial
(src)               vendors and related Sandia projects.  Additionally,
                    libraries for parsing (nidr), vector/matrix utilities
                    (Trilinos Teuchos), Boost C++ libraries, stochastic 
		    utilities (Pecos), algebraic interface (AMPL),
		    surface fitting (Surfpack), etc.

config (src)        m4 macros used for supporting autoconf and beta
		    implementation of CMake build macros/settings.

docs                The Users, Reference, and Developers Manuals are 
(src)               maintained here.  Other references are available from
                    the DAKOTA Web site (http://www.cs.sandia.gov/DAKOTA).

src (src)           The main source code repository for the DAKOTA system.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Installation.

Installation from binary packages is recommended when possible.  This
typically involves unpacking an archive and setting appropriate PATH
additions.  Compiling DAKOTA from source is based on GNU Autoconf
(configure/make).  For both paths, see the INSTALL file for detailed
instructions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------------

DAKOTA is actively supported with nightly build and regression test 
verifications on the following platforms for the given operating systems, 
C++ compilers, and MPI libraries:
