Choose a scaling type for each response
Description::
The
\c primary_scale_types specification includes strings specifying the
scaling type for each response value in methods that support
scaling, when scaling is enabled. 

Each entry in \c primary_scale_types may be selected from:
\li \c none - no scaling
\li \c value - characteristic value
\li \c log - logarithmic scaling

Automatic
scaling is not available for objective functions. If a single string
is specified it will apply to all responses.
