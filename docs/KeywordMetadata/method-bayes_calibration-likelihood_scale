Scale the \b log-likelihood function
Description::
The \c likelihood_scale is applied to the weighted sum-squared error 
term which is used in the log-likelihood function.  The 
log-likelihood is -0.5*the weighted sum-squared errors/the likelihood scale.
Thus, if the sum-squared errors is on the order of 1E+12, you will want to 
make the likelihood scale on the order of 1E+12 or 1E+11.  Similarly, 
if the weighted sum-squared errors is very small, the likelihood scale 
should be very small.  
<b> Note that applying a likelihood scale changes the formulation of the calibration problem. </b>  At this point, we only recommend using it for problems 
that are poorly conditioned and for which the MCMC is not working without 
applying some type of scaling.
