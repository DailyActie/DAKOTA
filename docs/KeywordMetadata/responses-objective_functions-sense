Tell Dakota whether to minimize or maximize each objective function
Description::
The \c sense keyword is used to declare whether an objective function
should be minimized or maximized.

The strings 
\li \c "minimization" 
\li \c "maximization"

Are the only options, but these can be shortened as \c "min" and \c "max".

The number of strings should either be equal to the number of 
objective functions, or one.
If a single
string is specified it will apply to each objective function.
