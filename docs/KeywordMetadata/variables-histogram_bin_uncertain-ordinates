Description::
Within the histogram bin uncertain optional group specification, the
number of histogram bin uncertain variables is a required
specification, the number of pairs is an optional key for
apportionment of abscissas/ordinates/counts, specification of
abscissas and either ordinates or counts is required, and the variable
descriptors is an optional specification. When using a histogram bin
variable, one must define at least one bin (with two bounding value
pairs).

The \c abscissas specification define abscissa values ("x"
coordinates) for the probability density function of each histogram variable. When paired with
\c counts, the specifications provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each
histogram variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency or
relative probability) associated with a bin. If using bins of unequal
width and specification of probability densities is more natural, then
the \c counts specification can be replaced with a \c ordinates
specification ("y" coordinates) in order to support interpretation of
the input as \c (x,y) pairs defining the profile of a "skyline" probability density function.
Conversion between the two specifications is straightforward: a
count/frequency is a cumulative probability quantity defined from the
product of the ordinate density value and the \c x bin width. Thus,
in the cases of bins of equal width, ordinate and count specifications
are equivalent. In addition, ordinates and counts may be relative
values; it is not necessary to scale them as all user inputs will be
normalized.
