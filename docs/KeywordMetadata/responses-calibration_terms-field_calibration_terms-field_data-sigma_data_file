Blurb::CAPABILITY NOT YET ACTIVE
Add main file name identifying where the experimental measurement error information will be located. 
Description::
The measurement error will be specified in \c sigma_data_file.  If there is more 
than one experiment, there will need to be K data files, where K = \c num_experiments. 
The sigma_data_files will contain one number in the case of constant measurement error
for all field data, a vector in the case of separate, independent measurement errors 
for each field data point, and a full covariance matrix for correlated measurement error.
