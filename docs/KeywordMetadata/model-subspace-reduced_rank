Blurb::
Explicitly specify the desired reduced rank

Description::
This control explicitly indicates the number of basis vectors to
retain.  The subspace model will include exactly \c reduced_rank
variables.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

Unlimited; as many basis vectors will be retained as are needed to
meet the convergence tolerance.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

This control can be helpful when a priori studies have identified the
essential information content in the variables space.
