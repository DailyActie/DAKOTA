Mesh Adaptive Direct Search Algorithm
Description::
The mesh adaptive direct search algorithm [\ref AuLeTr09a "Audet, Le
Digabel, and Tribes, 2009"] is a generalized pattern search in which
the set of points evaluated becomes increasingly dense, leading to
good convergence properties.  It is now made available in %Dakota
through the NOMAD software [\ref Nomad "Abramson, Audet, Couture,
Dennis, Le Digabel, and Tribes"].  It can handle unconstrained
problems as well as those with bound constraints and general nonlinear
constraints.  Of particular note, it can handle both continuous and
discrete parameters.  NOMAD is available to the public under the GNU
LGPL and the source code is included with %Dakota.  NOMAD-specific
software documentation is available from http://www.gerad.ca/nomad.
