Blurb::
Integer valued random variable defined by a histogram
Description::
This probability mass function is restricted to integer values -
meaning the abscissa values must all be integers.
The \c n abscissa values are paired with \c n \c counts which
indicate the relative frequency (mass) that the integer will appear,
relative to all other possible integers.

Examples::
\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain = 2
 integer
 pairs_per_variable = 2 3 
 abscissas = 3 4 100 200 300
 counts =    1 1 1   2   1
\endverbatim
There are two variables, the first one has two possible integer values which are equally probable.
The second one has three options, and 200 is twice as probable as 100 or 300 - appearing 1/2 of the time.
