Specify the number of iterator servers when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
The optional \c iterator_servers specification supports user override
 of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of iterator 
servers. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired number of
partitions at the iterator parallelism level. Refer to ParallelLibrary 
and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual 
[\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"] for additional information.
