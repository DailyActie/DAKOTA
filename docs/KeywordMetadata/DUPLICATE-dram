Blurb::  The use of the DRAM for the MCMC algorithm. 
Description::  The type of Markov Chain Monte Carlo used.  This keyword specifies the use of DRAM, (Delayed Rejection Adaptive Metropolis). 
DRAM is described in [\cite Haario "Haario et al. 2006"].  

<b> Default Behavior </b>

There are five possibilities for the MCMC algorithm currently:  dram, delayed_rejection, adaptive_metropolis, metropolis_hastings, and multilevel. 
The default is dram. 

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user knows very little about the proposal covariance, using dram 
is a recommended strategy.  The proposal covariance is adaptively updated, and the delayed rejection may help improve low acceptance rates.
