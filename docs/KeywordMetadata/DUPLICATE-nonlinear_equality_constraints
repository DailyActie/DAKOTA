Group to specify nonlinear equality constraints
Description::

The \c targets specification provides the targets for nonlinear
equalities of the form
\f[g(x) = g_t\f]
and the defaults for the equality targets enforce a value of \c 0.
for each constraint
\f[g(x) = 0.0\f]

The \c scale_types specifications include strings specifying the
scaling type for each nonlinear inequality or equality constraint,
respectively, in methods that support scaling, when scaling is
enabled. Each entry in \c scale_types may be selected from
<tt>'none'</tt>, <tt>'value'</tt>, <tt>'auto'</tt>, or <tt>'log'</tt>,
to select no, characteristic value, automatic, or logarithmic scaling,
respectively.  If a single string is specified it will apply to all
components of the relevant nonlinear constraint vector. Each entry in
\c scales may be a user-specified nonzero characteristic value to be
used in scaling each constraint component. These values are ignored
for scaling type <tt>'none'</tt>, required for <tt>'value'</tt>, and
optional for <tt>'auto'</tt> and <tt>'log'</tt>. If a single real
value is specified it will apply to each constraint.
