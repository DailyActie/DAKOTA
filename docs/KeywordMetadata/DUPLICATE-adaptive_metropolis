Blurb::  The use of Adaptive Metropolis for the MCMC algorithm. 
Description::  This keyword specifies the use of the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm.  That is, the "AM" part of DRAM is used but the "DR" part is not:  specifying this keyword involves only the Adaptive Metropolis part of the MCMC algorithm in which the covariance of the proposal density is updated adaptively.
 
<b> Default Behavior </b>

There are five possibilities for the MCMC algorithm currently:  dram, delayed_rejection, adaptive_metropolis, metropolis_hastings, and multilevel.
The default is dram.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user knows very little about the proposal covariance, but doesn't want to incur the 
cost of using full dram with both delayed rejection and adaptive metropolis, specifying 
only adaptive_metropolis offers a good strategy.
