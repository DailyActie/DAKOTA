Bayesian calibration
Description::
Currently, we are in the process of incorporating Bayesian calibration 
methods in %Dakota. These methods take prior information on parameter 
values (in the form of prior distributions) and observational data 
(e.g. from experiments) and produce posterior distributions on the 
parameter values. When the computational simulation is then executed
with samples from the posterior parameter distributions, the 
results that are produced are consistent with ("agree with") the 
experimental data. In the case of calibrating parameters from a 
computational simulation model, we require a "likelihood function" that 
specifies the likelihood of observing a particular observation given 
the model and its associated parameterization. We assume a Gaussian 
likelihood function currently. The algorithms that produce 
the posterior distributions on model parameters are Monte Carlo Markov 
Chain (MCMC) sampling algorithms. MCMC methods require many samples, often 
tens of thousands, so in the case of model calibration, often emulators 
of the computational simulation are used. For more details on the algorithms
underlying the methods, see the %Dakota User's manual. 

We have three Bayesian calibration methods under development in %Dakota: 
one called QUESO, one called DREAM, and one called GPMSA. They are specified with the
\c bayes_calibration \c queso, \c bayes_calibration \c dream, 
or \c bayes_calibration \c gpmsa, respectively. 
The QUESO method uses components from the QUESO library 
(Quantification of Uncertainty for Estimation, Simulation, and 
Optimization) developed at The University of Texas at Austin. 
We are using a DRAM (Delayed Rejected Adaptive Metropolis) algorithm 
for the MCMC sampling from the QUESO library. 
DREAM (DiffeRential Evolution Adaptive
Metropolis) is a method that runs multiple different chains simultaneously 
for global exploration, and automatically tunes the proposal covariance
during the process by a self-adaptive randomized subspace sampling. 
[\cite Vrugt2009].
GPMSA (Gaussian Process Models for Simulation Analysis) is 
a code that has been developed at Los Alamos National Laboratory. 
It uses Gaussian process models as part of constructing 
an emulator for the expensive 
computational simulation. GPMSA also has extensive features for 
calibration, such as the capability to include a "model discrepancy" term
and the capability to model functional data such as time series data. 
 
As mentioned above, the Bayesian capability in %Dakota currently relies 
on the QUESO library developed by The University of Texas at Austin. 
This integrated capability is still in prototype form and available to 
close collaborators of the %Dakota team.
If you are interested in this capability, contact the %Dakota developers
