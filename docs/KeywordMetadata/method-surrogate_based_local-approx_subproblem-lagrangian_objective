Lagrangian approximate subproblem formulation
Description::
For SBL problems with nonlinear constraints, a number of algorithm
formulations exist as described in [\ref Eldred2006a "Eldred and
Dunlavy, 2006"] and as summarized in the Advanced Examples section of
the Models chapter of the Users Manual [\ref UsersMan "Adams et al.,
2010"].  First, the "primary" functions (that is, the objective
functions or calibration terms) in the approximate subproblem can be
selected to be surrogates of the original primary functions (\c
original_primary), a single objective function (\c single_objective)
formed from the primary function surrogates, or either an augmented
Lagrangian merit function (\c augmented_lagrangian_objective) or a
Lagrangian merit function (\c lagrangian_objective) formed from the
primary and secondary function surrogates.  The former option may
imply the use of a nonlinear least squares method, a multiobjective
optimization method, or a single objective optimization method to
solve the approximate subproblem, depending on the definition of the
primary functions.  The latter three options all imply the use of a
single objective optimization method regardless of primary function
definition.
