Change how Dakota launches the analysis driver(s) and filters
Description::
!!!!!! is this correct? it is not mentioned in the manuals!!!!!

The typical commands that Dakota uses to launch analysis drivers are:
\verbatim
> input_filter parameters_file_name results_file_name 
> analysis_driver parameters_file_name results_file_name 
> output_filter parameters_file_name results_file_name 
\endverbatim
Dakota will automatically arrange the executables and file names.

If the analysis driver requires a different syntax, the entire
command can be specified as the analysis driver and the 
\c verbatim keyword will tell Dakota to use this as the command.

Note, this will not allow the use of \c file_tag, because the
full command must be specified.

For additional information on invocation syntax, see the Interfaces
chapter of the Users Manual [\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"].
