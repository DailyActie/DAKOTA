Blurb::  The use of Metropolis-Hastings for the MCMC algorithm. 
Description::  This keyword specifies the use of a Metropolis-Hastings algorithm for the MCMC chain generation.  Note that this means there is no delayed rejection and no adaptive proposal covariance updating as in DRAM. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>

There are five possibilities for the MCMC algorithm currently:  dram, delayed_rejection, adaptive_metropolis, metropolis_hastings, and multilevel.
The default is dram.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the user wants to use Metropolis-Hastings, possibly as a comparison to the other methods which 
involve more chain adaptation, this is the MCMC type to use.
