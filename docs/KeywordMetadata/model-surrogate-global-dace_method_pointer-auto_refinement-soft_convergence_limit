Blurb::
Maximum number of iterations without improvement in cross-validation
Description::
The purpose of this control is to cease auto-refinement when improvement
in the cross-validation score appears to have stalled or occurs too slowly.

A rolling average of improvement in the cross-validation score is computed
over \c soft_convergence_limit iterations. Auto-refinement is halted if the 
average becomes smaller than the \c convergence_tolerance.

The average is computed but ignored until the number of iterations has exceeded
\c soft_convergence_limit.

<b> Default Behavior </b>
Monitoring mean improvement of cross-validation is disabled by default.
