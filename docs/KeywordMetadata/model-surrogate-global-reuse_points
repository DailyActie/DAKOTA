Specify how to use existing training data
Description::
Dakota's global surrogate methods rely on training data, which can either
come from evaluation of a "truth" model, which is gathered by the method
specified with \ref model-surrogate-global-dace_method_pointer, OR from
a file of existing training data, identified by \ref model-surrogate-global-import_points_file.

If \c import_points_file is specified, \c reuse_points modifies how the file contents are used.

<ul>
  <li>\c all (default) - use all points in the file
  </li>
  <li>\c region - use only the points in the trust region
  </li>
  <li>\c none - ignore the contents of the file, and gather new training data
    using the specified method
  </li>
</ul>
