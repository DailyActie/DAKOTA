Discrete, epistemic uncertain variable - strings within a set

Description::
In addition to continuous and discrete aleatory probability
distributions, %Dakota provides support for continuous and discrete
epistemic uncertainties through the keywords:

\li \ref variables-continuous_interval_uncertain
\li \ref variables-discrete_interval_uncertain
\li \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-integer
\li \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-string
\li \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-real

Interval-based and set variables do
not represent probability distributions.

Discrete set
variables may be used to specify categorical choices which are
epistemic. For example, if we have three possible forms for a physics
model (model 1, 2, or 3) and there is epistemic uncertainty about
which one is correct, a discrete uncertain set 
may be used to represent this type of uncertainty.

This variable is defined by a set of 
integers, in which the discrete value may
take any value within the integer set (for example, the set may be
defined as 1, 2, and 4)
