Description::
Following
optimization of the approximate subproblem, the candidate iterate is
evaluated using a merit function, which can be selected to be a simple
penalty function with penalty ramped by surrogate_based_local iteration number (\c
penalty_merit), an adaptive penalty function where the penalty ramping
may be accelerated in order to avoid rejecting good iterates which
decrease the constraint violation (\c adaptive_penalty_merit), a
Lagrangian merit function which employs first-order Lagrange
multiplier updates (\c lagrangian_merit), or an augmented Lagrangian
merit function which employs both a penalty parameter and zeroth-order
Lagrange multiplier updates (\c augmented_lagrangian_merit). When an
augmented Lagrangian is selected for either the subproblem objective
or the merit function (or both), updating of penalties and multipliers
follows the approach described in [\cite Con00 "Conn et al., 2000"].
