Blurb::  Number of field calibration terms
Description::
This keyword describes the number of field calibration terms
Note that if there is one \c field_calibration_terms, but it has length 100 (meaning 100 values), then 
the user's simulation code must return 100 values.  
Also, if there are both scalar and field calibration, the user should specify 
the number of scalar terms as \c scalar_calibration_terms.  If there are only field calibration terms, 
it still is necessary to specify both \c field_calibration_terms = NN and \c calibration_terms = NN, 
where NN is the number of field calibration terms.

Theory::  Calibration terms are responses that are used with calibration
methods in Dakota, such as least squares optimizers.  Currently, each scalar term is added
to the total sum-of-squares error function presented to the optimizer. However,
each individual field value is added as well.   For example,
if you have one field calibration term with length 100 (e.g. a time-temperature trace
with 100 time points and 100 temperature points), the 100 temperature values
will be added to create the overall sum-of-squares error function used in
calibration.  NOTE: We plan to add a capability to interpolate the field data 
from the user's simulation to the experimental data.  For example, if the user
has thermocouple readings at 20 time points, it will be an experimental field response 
with 20 time points and 20 temperature values.  We plan to take the 100 simulation time-temperature 
values (from the example above) and interpolate those to the 20 experimental points, to create 
20 residual terms (simulation minus experimental data points) that will be used in calibration. 
As of release 6.1, however, this capability is not yet available in Dakota.
