Blurb::  The use of Delayed Rejection for the MCMC algorithm. 
Description::  This keyword specifies the use of the Delayed Rejection algorithm in which there can be a delay in rejecting samples from the chain.  That is, the "DR" part of DRAM is used but the "AM" part is not:  specifying this keyword involves a regular Metropolis-Hastings algorithm. 

<b> Default Behavior </b>

There are five possibilities for the MCMC algorithm currently:  dram, delayed_rejection, adaptive_metropolis, metropolis_hastings, and multilevel.  The default is dram. 

<b> Usage Tips </b>
If the user knows something about the proposal covariance or the proposal covariance 
is informed through derivative information, using 
delayed_rejection is preferred over dram:  the proposal covariance is already 
being informed by derivative information and the adaptive metropolis is not necessary.
