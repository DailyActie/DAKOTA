The order of the polynomial regression approximation within each Voronoi cell

Description:: 
VPS (Voronoi Piecewise Surrogate) models are used to construct high-dimensional surrogates fitting a few data points. 
The core idea in the VPS is to naturally decompose a high-dimensional domain into the corresponding implicit Voronoi tessellation, with the few given data points as Voronoi seeds. Each Voronoi cell the builds its own surrogate. 

The surrogate is an arbitrary order polynomial that passes through the cell's seed, and optimally fits its local neighbors by minimizing their error in the least squares sense. The surrogate_order keyword specifies the order of this polynomial.
