Name of a sub-method to apply to surrogate model
Description::
The \c surrogate_based_local and \c surrogate_based_global methods
must specify an optimization or least squares sub-method to apply to
the surrogate model.

Option 2 is using \c approx_method_name (e.g., 'npsol_sqp') which
identifies a sub-method for the sub-problem minimizer (which will use
default minimizer settings).
