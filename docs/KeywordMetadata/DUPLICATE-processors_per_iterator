Specify the number of processors per iterator server  when Dakota is run in parallel
Description::
The optional \c processors_per_iterator specification supports user override
of the automatic parallel configuration for the number of processors in each
iterator server. That is, if the automatic configuration is
undesirable for some reason, the user can enforce a desired server size
at the iterator parallelism level. Refer to ParallelLibrary 
and the Parallel Computing chapter of the Users Manual 
[\cite UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"] for additional information.
