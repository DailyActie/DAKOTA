The merit function by Vanderbei and Shanno
Description::
The "van_shanno" merit function can be classified as a penalty
function for the logarithmic barrier formulation of the nonlinear
programming problem. The cost per linesearch iteration is one
function evaluation. For more information see 
[\ref VanShanno1999 "Vanderbei and Shanno, 1999"].

If the function evaluation is expensive or noisy, set the \c
merit_function to "argaez_tapia" or "van_shanno".
