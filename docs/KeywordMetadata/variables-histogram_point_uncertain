Aleatory uncertain discrete variable defined by a histogram

Description::

Histogram uncertain variables are typically used to model a set of
empirical data.  When the data are discrete values or categories, a
histogram describes a probability mass function.  Dakota has three
types of discrete histograms, depending on the data type: integer,
real, or string.

A discrete histogram is specified by its datatype, and by
abscissa/count pairs.  The abscissas are the possible values the
variable can take on (integers, strings, or reals).  The count
paired an abscissa indicates the relative frequency that theof this
value/string, relative to the other possible values/strings.

At least one set of abscissa/count pairs must be specified.  Abscissas
must be specified in increasing order (lexicographic for strings).

<!--
In this case, the histogram's "bins" have zero width.
Point histograms are similar to \ref variables-discrete_design_set-real and \ref variables-discrete_state_set-real, but
differ in the inclusion of information on the relative probabilities
of observing the different values within the set.


The \c
abscissas define abscissa values ("x" coordinates) for
the PDF of each histogram variable.
These are paired with \c counts which
provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each histogram
variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency)
associated with a point.

To fully specify a point-based histogram with \c n points, \c n
\c (x,c) pairs must be specified with the following features:

\li \c x is the point value and \c c is the corresponding count 
 for that value.
\li the \c x values must be strictly increasing.
\li all \c c values must be positive.
\li a minimum of one pair must be specified for each point-based histogram.

The \c num_pairs specification provides for the proper association of
multiple sets of \c (x,c) or \c (x,y) pairs with individual histogram
variables. For example, in the following specification,

\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain = 2
 num_pairs = 2   3 
 abscissas = 3 4 100 200 300
 counts = 1 1 1 2 1
\endverbatim

\c num_pairs associates the \c (x,c) pairs ((3,1),(4,1)) with one
point-based histogram variable (where the values 3 and 4 are equally
probable) and associates the \c (x,c) pairs ((100,1),(200,2),(300,1))
with a second point-based histogram variable (where the value 200 is
twice as probable as either 100 or 300).
