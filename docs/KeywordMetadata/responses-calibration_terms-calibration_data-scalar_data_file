Blurb::
This refers to the specification of scalar data in a mixed-case where the 
user is calibrating both scalar and field data. 
Description::

If the user is specifying BOTH scalar and field calibration terms, AND 
has associated experimental data to provide for each, the scalar data may be provided 
in the file named by \c scalar_data_file.  This file follows the same format as: 
\ref responses-calibration_terms-calibration_data_file.
