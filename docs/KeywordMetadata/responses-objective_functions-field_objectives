Blurb::  Number of field objective functions
Description::
This keyword describes the number of field objective functions. 
Note that if there is one \c field_objective, but it has length 100 (meaning 100 values), then 
the user's simulation code must return 100 values.  
Also, if there are both scalar and field objectives, the user should specify 
the number of scalar objectives as \c scalar_objectives.  If there are only field objectives, 
it still is necessary to specify both \c objective_functions = NN and \c field_objectives = NN, 
where NN is the number of field objectives.

Theory::  Objective functions are responses that are used with optimization
methods in Dakota.  Currently, each term in a field objective is added
to the total objective function presented to the optimizer.  For example,
if you have one field objective with 100 terms (e.g. a time-temperature trace
with 100 time points and 100 corresponding temperature points), the 100 temperature values
will be added to create the overall objective.
