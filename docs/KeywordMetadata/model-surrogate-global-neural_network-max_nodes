Blurb::
Maximum number of hidden layer nodes

Description::

Limits the number of hidden layer nodes in the neural network model.
By default is to use one less node than available training data points
yielding a fully-determined linear least squares problem.  However,
reducing the number of nodes can help reduce overfitting and more
importantly, can drastically reduce surrogate construction time when
building from a large data set.  Historically, Dakota limited the
number of nodes to 100.
