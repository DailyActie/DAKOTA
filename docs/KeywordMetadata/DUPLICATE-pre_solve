Blurb:: Perform deterministic optimization for MAP before Bayesian calibration

Description::
When specified, Dakota will perform a deterministic gradient-based
optimization to maximize the log posterior (log-likelihood -
log_prior).  The Markov Chain in Bayesian calibration will be started
at the best point found in the optimization (the MAP point).

<b> Default Behavior </b>
No MAP pre-solve; simply start the MCMC process at the user-specified
initial value.

<b> Expected Output </b>
When pre-solve is enabled, the output will include a deterministic
optimization, followed by a Bayesian calibration.  The final results
will include the MAP point as well as posterior statistics from the
MCMC chain.
