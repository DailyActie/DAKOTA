Surrogate-Based local constraint relaxation method for infeasible iterates
Description::
Currently, \c homotopy [\ref Perez2004 "Perez et al., 2004"] is the
only available method for constraint relaxation, and this method is
dependent on the presence of the NPSOL library within the %Dakota
executable. Table \ref T5d12 "5.12" summarizes these constraint
management inputs.
