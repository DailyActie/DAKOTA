Use Stochastic Collocation to generate a polynomial surrogate model
Description::
This specifies the use of a stochastic collocation (SC) model to be used as a surrogate model in the likelihood calculations used in the Bayesian computations. When using SC as a surrogate within the Bayesian framework, the build points (training points) for the stochastic collocation are constructed from a sparse grid.
