Use a Polynomial Chaos Expansion surrogate model
Description::
This specifies the use of a polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) model to be used as a surrogate model in the likelihood calculations used in the Bayesian computations. When using PCE as a surrogate within the Bayesian framework, the build points (training points) for the PCE are constructed from a sparse grid.
