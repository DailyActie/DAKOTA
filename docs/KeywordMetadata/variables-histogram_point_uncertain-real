Blurb::
Real valued random variable defined by a histogram
Description::
This probability mass function is restricted to real values -
meaning the abscissa values must all be real numbers.
The \c n abscissa values are paired with \c n \c counts which
indicate the relative frequency (mass) that the real number will appear,
relative to all other possible real numbers.

\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain = 2
 integer
 pairs_per_variable = 2 3 
 abscissas = 3.1415 4.5389 100 200.112345 300
 counts =    1      1      1   2          1
\endverbatim
There are two variables, the first one has two possible real values which are equally probable.
The second one has three options, and 200.112345 is twice as probable as 100 or 300 - appearing 1/2 of the time.
