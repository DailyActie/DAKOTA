Description::  This keyword specifies the use of the Adaptive Metropolis algorithm.  That is, the "AM" part of DRAM is used but the "DR" part is not:  specifying this keyword involves only the Adaptive Metropolis part of the MCMC algorithm in which the covariance of the proposal density is updated adaptively.
