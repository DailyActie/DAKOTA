Markov Chain Monte Carlo algorithm with Gaussian Process Surrogate
Description::
For the GPMSA method, one can define the number of samples which will be used 
in construction of the emulator, \c emulator_samples. The emulator 
involves Gaussian processes in GPMSA, so the user does not specify anything 
about emulator type. At this point, the only controls active for GPMSA 
are \c emulator_samples, \c seed and \c rng, and \c samples (the number of MCMC
samples).  Note the GPMSA method is in a very preliminary state at this time.
