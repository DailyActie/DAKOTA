Multiplier for the penalty function
Description::
\li \c constraint_penalty: the initial multiplier for the penalty
function, must be nonnegative

Most SCOLIB optimizers treat constraints
with a simple penalty scheme that adds \c constraint_penalty times the
sum of squares of the constraint violations to the objective function.
Specific exceptions to this method for handling constraint violations
are noted below. (The default value of \c constraint_penalty is
1000.0, except for methods that dynamically adapt their constraint
penalty, for which the default value is 1.0.)
