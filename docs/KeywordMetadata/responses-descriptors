Label the responses
Description::
The optional response labels specification \c descriptors is a list
of strings which will be printed in %Dakota output to identify the values
for particular response functions.

Note that the descriptors \b currently must match the order of the values
in the results file. See the example below.

The default descriptor strings use a root string plus a numeric identifier. 
This root string is
\li \c "obj_fn" for objective functions
\li \c "least_sq_term" for least squares terms
\li \c "response_fn" for generic response functions
\li \c "nln_ineq_con" for nonlinear inequality constraints
\li \c "nln_eq_con" for nonlinear equality constraints

Examples::
Note that the descriptors \b currently must match the order of the values
in the results file.

For example, if the \c responses block contains:
\verbatim
  \c descriptors 'x1' 'x2' 'x3'
\endverbatim

and the results file contains

\verbatim
  4 x1
  5 x3
  6 x2
\endverbatim

Then Dakota will still report the results as:
\verbatim
  x1 = 4
  x2 = 5
  x3 = 6
\endverbatim
