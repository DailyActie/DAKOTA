Blurb::
Specify a datafile of points to compare surrogate responses against
Description::
If a file is specified, it must contain variables and response data.

The surrogate is evaluated at the points
in the file, and the surrogate responses are compared against
the results in the file.

The requested metrics will be reported for the surrogate
evaluated at the specified variables versus the function values from
the challenge data file.

The imported points file may be in annotated
for free-form tabular format.
