Blurb::
Add main file name identifying where the experimental coordinate data will be located. 
Description::
The coordinate data will be specified in \c field_coordinate_data_file.  If there is more 
than one experiment, there will need to be K data files, where K = \c num_experiments. 
Each coordinate data should contain \c num_coordinates_per_field columns, 
where each column represents an independent coordinate which the field data is a function of. 
For example, the independent coordinate in time-temperature field data is time, and 
the field data itself is temperature.
