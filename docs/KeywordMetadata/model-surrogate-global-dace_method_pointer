Specify a method to gather training data
Description::
The number of training points and the sources are specified on
\ref model-surrogate-global, as well as the number of new training points
required.

New training points are gathered by running the "truth" model using
the method specified by \c dace_method_pointer.
The DACE method will only be
invoked if it has new samples to perform, and if new samples are
required and no DACE iterator has been provided, an error will result.

The \c dace_method_pointer points to design of experiments method
block 
used to generate truth model data.

Permissible methods include: 
Monte Carlo (random) sampling, Latin
hypercube sampling, orthogonal array sampling, central composite
design sampling, and Box-Behnken sampling.
