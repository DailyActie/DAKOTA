Pointer to sub-method to apply to surrogate
Description::

The \c surrogate_based_local and \c surrogate_based_global methods
must specify an optimization or least squares sub-method to apply to
the surrogate model.

Option 1 is using \c approx_method_pointer (e.g., 'NLP1') which
identifies a full sub-method specification for the sub-problem
minimizer (which allows non-default minimizer settings).

Any \c model_pointer identified in an approximate sub-method
specification is ignored. The surrogate model is pointed from the \c
model_pointer keyword in the \c surrogate_based_local and \c
surrogate_based_global \c method block.
