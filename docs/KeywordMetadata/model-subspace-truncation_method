Description::
Metric that controls how many basis vectors are retained in the active
subspace.  For example based on eigenvalue gap or trade-off in
eigenvalue energy vs. bootstrap replicate variability.

The default is to use the Bing-Li "ladle" diagnostic.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

If the automated diagnostics do not yield desirable results, consider
using the explicit \c reduced_rank truncation option.
