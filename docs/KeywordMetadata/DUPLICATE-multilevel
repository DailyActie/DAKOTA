Blurb::  The use of the multilevel algorithm for the MCMC algorithm. 
Description::  This keyword specifies the use of the multilevel algorithm which is described in \cite Prudencio.
 
<b> Default Behavior </b>

There are five possibilities for the MCMC algorithm currently:  dram, delayed_rejection, adaptive_metropolis, metropolis_hastings, and multilevel.
The default is dram.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The multilevel algorithm is a more experimental algorithm than the other MCMC approaches mentioned above. 
It works well in cases where the prior can be "evolved" to a posterior in a structured way.
