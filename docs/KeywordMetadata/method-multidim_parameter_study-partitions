Specify the grid of points in the study
Description::
The \c
partitions list specifies the number of partitions for each
variable. The number of grid points in each dimension is the
number of partitions + 1.

The number of entries in the partitions list must be equal
to the total number of variables contained in the variables
specification. 

Remainders
within the integer division of the step calculations are not permitted
for discrete range or set types and therefore no integer rounding
occurs, so the partitions specification must be carefully selected in
the presence of these types.
