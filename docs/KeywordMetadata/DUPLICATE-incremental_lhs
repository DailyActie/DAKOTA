Augment an existing LHS study
Description::
\c incremental_lhs will augment an existing LHS sampling study with more
samples to get better estimates of mean, variance, and percentiles.

To use this \c sample_type, a previous LHS sampling study with sample size N must have
already been performed, and the dakota restart file must be
available from this previous study. The variables and 
responses specifications must be the same in both studies.

The syntax for
running the second sample set is: 
\verbatim 
dakota -i input2.in -r dakota.rst
\endverbatim
where \c input2.in is the file which specifies
incremental sampling and dakota.rst is the restart
file containing the results of the previous study. 

The number of samples in the second
set MUST currently be 2 times the number of previous samples, although
incremental sampling based on any power of two may be supported in
future releases.

Examples::
For example, say a user performs
an initial study using \c lhs as the \c sample_type, and generates 50
samples. If the user creates a new input file where \c samples is now
specified to be 100, the \c sample_type is defined to be \c
incremental_lhs, and \c previous_samples is
specified to be 50, the user will get 50 new LHS samples which
maintain both the correlation and stratification of the original LHS
sample. The N new samples will be combined with the N original
samples to generate a combined sample of size 2N.
