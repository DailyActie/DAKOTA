Radial Basis Functions
Description::
Radial basis functions are functions whose value typically depends on the 
distance from a center point, called the centroid, \f${\bf c}\f$. 
The surrogate model approximation is then built up as the sum of K 
weighted radial basis functions: 
\f[ \hat{f}({\bf x})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{k}\phi({\parallel {\bf x} - {\bf c_{k}} \parallel}) \f]

where the \f$\phi\f$ are the individual radial basis functions. 
These functions can be of any form, but often a Gaussian bell-shaped 
function or splines are used. 
Our implementation uses a Gaussian radial basis function. 
The weights are determined via a linear least squares solution approach.
See \ref Orr96 for more details.
