Radial Basis Functions

Description::
Radial basis functions are functions whose value typically depends on the 
distance from a center point, called the centroid, ${\bf c}$. 
The surrogate model approximation is then built up as the sum of K 
weighted radial basis functions: 

\begin{equation}
 \hat{f}({\bf x})=\sum_{k=1}^{K}w_{k}\phi({\parallel {\bf x} - {\bf c_{k}} \parallel})
 \label{models:surf:equation11} 
\end{equation}

where the $\phi$ are the individual radial basis functions. 
These functions can be of any form, but often a Gaussian bell-shaped 
function or splines are used. 
Our implementation uses a Gaussian radial basis function. 
The weights are determined via a linear least squares solution approach.
See \ref{Orr96} for more details.
