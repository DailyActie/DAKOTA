Artificial Neural Network Models
Description::
The Artificial Neural Network surrogate in Dakota employs a stochastic layered
perceptron artificial neural network based on the direct
training approach of Zimmerman \cite Zim96.

The method is
designed to have a lower training cost than traditional neural networks.
This is
a useful feature for surrogate-based optimization and
optimization under uncertainty, where new surrogates are constructed many
times during the optimization process (i.e., one surrogate for each response
function, and new surrogates for each optimization iteration).

The nueral network is a non parametric surface fitting method. Thus, along
with kriging (Gaussian Process) and MARS,
it can be used to model data trends that have
slope discontinuities as well as multiple maxima and minima. However,
unlike kriging, the neural network surrogate is not guaranteed to exactly match the
response values of the data points from which it was constructed. 

This surrogate
can be constructed from fewer than \f$n_{c_{quad}}\f$ data points,
however, it is a good rule of thumb to use at least \f$n_{c_{quad}}\f$
data points when possible.

The form of
the SLP ANN model is

\f[ \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx
 \tanh(\tanh((\mathbf{x A}_{0}+\theta_{0})\mathbf{A}_{1}+\theta_{1})) \f]

where \f$\mathbf{x}\f$ is the current point in \f$n\f$-dimensional parameter
space, and the terms
\f$\mathbf{A}_{0},\theta_{0},\mathbf{A}_{1},\theta_{1}\f$ are the matrices
and vectors that correspond to the neuron weights and offset values in
the ANN model. These terms are computed during the ANN training
process, and are analogous to the polynomial coefficients in a
quadratic surface fit. A singular value decomposition method is used
in the numerical methods that are employed to solve for the weights
and offsets.
