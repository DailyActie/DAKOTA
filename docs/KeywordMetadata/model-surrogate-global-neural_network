Artificial Neural Network (ANN) Models

Description::
The ANN surface fitting method in Dakota employs a stochastic layered
perceptron (SLP) artificial neural network based on the direct
training approach of Zimmerman \cite Zim96. The SLP ANN method is
designed to have a lower training cost than traditional ANNs. This is
a useful feature for SBO and OUU where new ANNs are constructed many
times during the optimization process (i.e., one ANN for each response
function, and new ANNs for each optimization iteration). The form of
the SLP ANN model is

\f[ \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx
 \tanh(\tanh((\mathbf{x A}_{0}+\theta_{0})\mathbf{A}_{1}+\theta_{1})) \f]

where \f$\mathbf{x}\f$ is the current point in \f$n\f$-dimensional parameter
space, and the terms
\f$\mathbf{A}_{0},\theta_{0},\mathbf{A}_{1},\theta_{1}\f$ are the matrices
and vectors that correspond to the neuron weights and offset values in
the ANN model. These terms are computed during the ANN training
process, and are analogous to the polynomial coefficients in a
quadratic surface fit. A singular value decomposition method is used
in the numerical methods that are employed to solve for the weights
and offsets.

The SLP ANN is a non parametric surface fitting method. Thus, along
with kriging and MARS, it can be used to model data trends that have
slope discontinuities as well as multiple maxima and minima. However,
unlike kriging, the ANN surface is not guaranteed to exactly match the
response values of the data points from which it was constructed. This
ANN can be used with SBO and OUU strategies. As with kriging, this ANN
can be constructed from fewer than \f$n_{c_{quad}}\f$ data points,
however, it is a good rule of thumb to use at least \f$n_{c_{quad}}\f$
data points when possible.
