Denotes annotated file format

Description::
An annotated file is a text file with one leading row of
comments/column labels and one leading column of evaluation/row IDs
surrounding num\_rows x num\_cols whitespace-separated numeric data,
(newlines separating rows are not currently required, but may be in
the future). The numeric data in a row may correspond to variables,
variables followed by responses, data point for calibration, etc.,
depending on context.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota expects point files to be in annotated format.  To
explicitly specify this in the Dakota input file, however, the \c
annotated keyword must be used in conjunction with the \c
import_points_file keyword.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
free-form format. They now default to annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.
\li For both formats, a warning will be generated if a specific number
of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when
there is insufficient data.
\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the free-form option.
