Selects annotated tabular file format

Description::
An annotated tabular file is a whitespace-separated text file with one
leading header row of comments/column labels.  Each subsequent row
contains an evaluation ID and interface ID, followed by data for
variables, or variables followed by responses, depending on context.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

By default, Dakota imports and exports tabular files in annotated
format.  The \c annotated keyword can be used to explicitly specify
this.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li To specify pre-Dakota 6.1 tabular format, which did not include
interface_id, specify \c custom_annotated \c header \c eval_id

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
in free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the \c freeform option.

Examples::

Import an annotated points file containing a header row, leading
eval_id and interface_id columns, and data for variables to perform a
parameter study.

  list_parameter_study
    import_points_file = 'dakota_pstudy.3.dat'
    annotated
