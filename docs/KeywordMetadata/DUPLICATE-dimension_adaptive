Description::
Perform automated expansion refinement by adapting to dimensions with higher `importance'.
Dimension_adaptive refinement can be further specified as either sobol or generalized (decay not supported). Each of these automated refinement approaches makes use of the max_iterations and convergence_tolerance iteration controls
