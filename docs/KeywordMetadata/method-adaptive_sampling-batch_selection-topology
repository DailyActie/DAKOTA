Topology... Morse-Smale
Description::
In this strategy we look at the topology of the scoring function and select the
\c n highest maxima in the topology. To determine local maxima, we construct the
approximate Morse-Smale complex. This strategy does require the user to have the 
Morse-Smale package.
