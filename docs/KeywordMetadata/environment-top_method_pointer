Blurb:: Identify which method leads the Dakota study

Description::

An optional \c top_method_pointer specification may be used to point
to a particular method specification that will lead the Dakota
analysis.  The associated string must be a method identifier specified
via \ref method-id_method.  If \c top_method_pointer is not used, then
it will be inferred as decribed in \ref environment (no \c
top_method_pointer within an environment specification is treated the
same as no environment specification).
