Selects freeform file format

Description::

A freeform tabular file is whitespace-separated text file with no
leading header row and no leading columns.  Most commonly, each row
contains data for variables, or variables followed by responses,
though the format is used for other tabular exports/imports as well.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The \c annotated format is the default for tabular export/import. To
change this behavior, specify \c freeform in the relevant
export/import context.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
free-form format. They now default to \c annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.

\li When importing tabular data, a warning will be generated if a
specific number of data are expected, but extra is found and an error
generated when there is insufficient data.

\li In \c freeform, the num_rows x num_cols total data entries may be
separated with any whitespace including spaces, tabs, and newlines. In
this format, vectors may therefore appear as a single row or single
column (or mixture; entries will populate the vector in order).

\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the \c freeform option.
