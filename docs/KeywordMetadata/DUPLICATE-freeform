Denotes freeform file format

Description::
A freeform file is text file with no leading row and no leading
column. The num_rows x num_cols total numeric data entries may appear
separated with any whitespace including arbitrary spaces, tabs, and
newlines. In this format, vectors may therefore appear as a single row
or single column (or mixture; entries will populate the vector in
order).

<b> Default Behavior </b>

The freeform format is not used by Dakota by default.  To change this
behavior, the \c freeform keyword must be used in conjunction with the
\c import_points_file keyword.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data files were
free-form format. They now default to annotated format, though \c
freeform remains an option.
\li For both formats, a warning will be generated if a specific number
of data are expected, but extra is found and an error generated when
there is insufficient data.
\li Some TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only
support the free-form option.
