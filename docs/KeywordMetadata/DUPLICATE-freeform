Blurb::
Specified file is in the freeform format
Description::
Free-form Matrix: text file with no leading row and no leading 
column. The num_rows x num_cols total numeric data entries may 
appear separated with any whitespace including arbitrary spaces, 
tabs, and newlines. In this format, vectors may therefore appear 
as a single row or single column (or mixture; entries will 
populate the vector in order). 

<b> Important Notes </b>

\li Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data 
files were free-form format. They now default to annotated format, 
though \c freeform remains an option. 
\li For both formats, a warning 
will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra 
is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data. 
\li Some 
TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only support 
the free-form option.
