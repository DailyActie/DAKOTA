Probability of executing local searches
Description::
In the \c embedded approach, global and local method strings supplied
with the \c global_method_pointer and \c local_method_pointer
specifications identify the two methods to be used. As for other
meta-iterators, method pointers can be replaced by method names and
optional model pointers.  The \c local_search_probability setting is
an optional specification for supplying the probability (between 0.0
and 1.0) of employing local search to improve estimates within the
global search.
