Moving Least Squares surrogate models
Description::
Moving least squares is a further generalization of weighted least squares
where the weighting is "moved" or recalculated for every new point where 
a prediction is desired \cite Nea04.

<b> The implementation of moving least squares is still under development. </b>
We have found that it works well 
in trust region methods where the surrogate model is constructed in 
a constrained region over a few points. It does not appear to be working 
as well globally, at least at this point in time.

Theory::
Moving Least Squares can be considered a more specialized 
version of linear regression models. In linear regression, 
one usually attempts to minimize the sum of the squared residuals, 
where the residual is defined as the difference between the 
surrogate model and the true model at a fixed number of points. 

In weighted least squares, the residual terms are weighted so the 
determination of the optimal coefficients governing the polynomial 
regression function, denoted by \f$\hat{f}({\bf x})\f$, are obtained by 
minimizing the weighted sum of squares at N data points: 

\f[ \sum_{n=1}^{N}w_{n}({\parallel \hat{f}({\bf x_{n}})-f({\bf x_{n}})\parallel}) \f]
