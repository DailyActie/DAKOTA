k-fold cross validation
Description::
General k-fold cross validation may be
performed by specifying \c cross_validation.

The cross-validation statistics will be calculated
for all metrics.

Cross validation may include
either
\li \c folds, the number of folds into which to divide the build
  data (between 2 and number of data points) or
\li \c percent, the fraction of data (between 0 and 0.5)
  to use in each fold.

These will
be adjusted as needed based on the number of available training
points.
