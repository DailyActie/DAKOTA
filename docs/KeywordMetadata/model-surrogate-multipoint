Description::
Multipoint approximations use data from previous design points to
improve the accuracy of local approximations. Currently, the
Two-point Adaptive Nonlinearity %Approximation (TANA-3) method of
[\ref Xu1998 "Xu and Grandhi, 1998"] is supported. This method
requires response value and gradient information from two points, and
uses a first-order Taylor series if only one point is available. The
truth model to be used to generate the value/gradient data used in the
approximation is identified through the required \c
actual_model_pointer specification.

Multipoint approximations involve response data from two or more
points in parameter space, often involving the current and previous
iterates of a minimization algorithm. Available techniques currently
include:

<b> TANA-3 </b>: This multipoint approximation uses a two-point
exponential approximation \ref Xu98,Fad90 built with response value
and gradient information from the current and previous iterates.
