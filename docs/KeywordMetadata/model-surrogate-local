Description::
Local approximations use value, gradient, and possibly Hessian data
from a single point to form a series expansion for approximating data
in the vicinity of this point.  The currently available local
approximation is the \c taylor_series selection.  The order of the
Taylor series may be either first-order or second-order, which is
automatically determined from the gradient and Hessian specifications
in the responses specification (see \ref RespGrad and \ref RespHess)
for the truth model.
<!-- The first-order Taylor series expansion is known as the -->
<!-- "linear approximation" in the optimization literature.  Other local -->
<!-- approximations, such as the "reciprocal" and "conservative/convex" -->
<!-- approximations, may become available in the future. -->
The truth model to be used to generate the value/gradient/Hessian data
used in the series expansion is identified through the required \c
actual_model_pointer specification.  The use of a model pointer (as
opposed to an interface pointer) allows additional flexibility in
defining the approximation.  In particular, the derivative
specification for the truth model may differ from the derivative
specification for the approximation , and the truth model results
being approximated may involve a model recursion (e.g., the
values/gradients from a nested model).  \ref T6d8 "Table 6.8"
summarizes the local approximation interface specifications.
