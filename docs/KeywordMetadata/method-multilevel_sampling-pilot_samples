Blurb:: Initial set of samples for multifidelity sampling methods.

Description:: The pilot sample provides initial estimates of variance and/or
correlation within the first iteration of a multilevel and/or control variate
approach.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

100 samples per model fidelity and/or discretization level.

<!-- <b> Expected Output </b> -->

<b> Usage Tips </b>

The number of specified values can be none (default values used), one
(all fidelities and levels use the same value), the number of
discretization levels for every model (each model uses the same
discretization level profile), or the aggregate number of
discretization levels for all models (each discretization level is
distinct for each model).
