Select the type of emulator used to estimate the Probability of Failure in POF Darts
Description::
There are two types of emulators used to estimate the Probability of Failure in POF Darts: 
a Gaussian process emulator, specified by \c gaussian_process, and a Voronoi Piecewise 
Surrogate, specified by \c voronoi_surrogate. 
The Gaussian process emulator is a global emulator (one emulator over the entire domain). 
The Voronoi surrogate constructs many local emulators:  it 
constructs a separate polynomial regression surrogate in each Voronoi cell, based 
on the surrounding neighbors and the order of the polynomial specified.
