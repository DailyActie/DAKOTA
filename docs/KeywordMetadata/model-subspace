Active (variable) subspace model

Description::
A model that transforms the original model (given by \c
actual_model_pointer) to one with a reduced set of variables.  This
reduced model is identified by iteratively sampling the gradient of
the original model and performing a singular value decomposition of
the gradient matrix.

<b> Expected Output </b>

When active, a subspace model will perform an initial sampling design,
potentially followed by bootstrap sampling-guided refinement steps to
identify the active subspace.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Consider using options for total energy vs. eigenvalue gap to avoid missing the most efficient subspace truncation.

Topics::

Examples::
Perform an initial 100 samples to identify the active subspace, then
refine by adding 2 samples at a time until either the convergence
tolerance or maximum iterations are reached.

Theory::
The idea behind active subspaces is to find directions in the input variable
space in which the quantity of interest is nearly constant. After rotation of
the input variables, this method can allow significant dimension reduction. Below is a brief summary of the process.

1. Compute the gradient of the quantity of interest, \f$q = f(\mathbf{x})\f$,
    at several locations sampled from the full input space,
    \f[\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i = \nabla f(\mathbf{x}_i).\f]

2. Compute the eigendecomposition of the matrix \f$\hat{\mathbf{C}}\f$,
    \f[\hat{\mathbf{C}} = \frac{1}{M}\sum_{i=1}^{M}\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i\nabla_{\mathbf{x}} f_i^T = \hat{\mathbf{W}}\hat{\mathbf{\Lambda}}\hat{\mathbf{W}}^T,\f]
    where \f$\hat{\mathbf{W}}\f$ has eigenvectors as columns, 
    \f$\hat{\mathbf{\Lambda}} = \text{diag}(\hat{\lambda}_1,\:\ldots\:,\hat{\lambda}_N)\f$
    contains eigenvalues, and \f$N\f$ is the total number of parameters.

3. Using a \ref model-subspace-truncation_method or specifying a
    \ref model-subspace-reduced_rank to estimate the active subspace size, 
    split the eigenvectors into active and inactive directions,
    \f[\hat{\mathbf{W}} = \left[\hat{\mathbf{W}}_1\quad\hat{\mathbf{W}}_2\right].\f]
    These eigenvectors are used to rotate the input variables.

4. Next the input variables, \f$\mathbf{x}\f$, are expanded in terms of active and
    inactive variables,
    \f[\mathbf{x} = \hat{\mathbf{W}}_1\mathbf{y} + \hat{\mathbf{W}}_2\mathbf{z}.\f]

5. A surrogate is then built as a function of the active variables,
    \f[g(\mathbf{y}) \approx f(\mathbf{x})\f]
