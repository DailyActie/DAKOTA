Active (variable) subspace model

Description::
A model that transforms the original model (given by \c
actual_model_pointer) to one with a reduced set of variables.  This
reduced model is identified by iteratively sampling the gradient of
the original model and performing a singular value decomposition of
the gradient matrix.

<b> Expected Output </b>

When active, a subspace model will perform an initial sampling design,
potentially followed by bootstrap sampling-guided refinement steps to
identify the active subspace.

<b> Usage Tips </b>

Consider using options for total energy vs. eigenvalue gap to avoid missing the most efficient subspace truncation.

Examples::
Perform an initial 100 samples to identify the active subspace, then
refine by adding 2 samples at a time until either the convergence
tolerance or maximum iterations are reached.
