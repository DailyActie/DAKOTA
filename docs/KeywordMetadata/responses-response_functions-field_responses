Blurb::  Number of field responses functions
Description::
This keyword describes the number of field response functions. 
Note that if there is one \c field_response, but it has length 100 (meaning 100 values), then 
the user's simulation code must return 100 values.  
Also, if there are both scalar and field responses, the user should specify 
the number of scalar responses as \c scalar_responses.  If there are only field responses, 
it still is necessary to specify both \c response_functions = NN and \c field_responses = NN, 
where NN is the number of field responses.

Theory::
This type of data set is used by uncertainty
quantification methods, in which the effect of parameter uncertainty
on response functions is quantified, and can also be used in parameter
study and design of experiments methods (although these methods are
not restricted to this data set), in which the effect of parameter
variations on response functions is evaluated.
