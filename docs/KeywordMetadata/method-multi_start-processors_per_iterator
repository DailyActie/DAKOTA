Number of processors per iterator serve
Description::
An important feature for component-based iterators is that execution
of sub-iterator runs may be performed concurrently.  The \c
iterator_servers, \c processors_per_iterator, and \c
iterator_scheduling specifications provide manual overrides for the
number of concurrent iterator partitions, the size of iterator
partitions, and the scheduling configuration (\c master or \c peer),
respectively, for concurrent iterator jobs.  These settings are
normally determined automatically in the parallel configuration
routines (see ParallelLibrary) but can be overridden with user inputs
if desired.  Currently, \c hybrid, \c multi_start, and \c pareto_set
component-based iterators support concurrency in their sub-iterators.
