Have Dakota set up working directories before launching analysis driver
Description::
It is often convenient to run function evaluations in a different
directory than the one where Dakota is invoked.

Say that Dakota is invoked in a directory called \c DakotaDir.
When the \c work_directory feature is enabled,
%Dakota will run the function evaluations in \c DakotaDir/workdir/
If that directory does not exist, it will be created.

The function evaluation proceeds by:
-# changing the <em>present working directory </em> to the newly created work directory
-# adding the Dakota directory, \c DakotaDir, to the \e PATH
-# writing the parameters file
-# running the same commands to launch the analysis_drivers, filters, etc.
-# reading the results file
!!!!!!!!!!! is this right?

<b> Note several changes in behavior </b>

-# The parameters and results file do not appear in the Dakota directory, \c DakotaDir in this example
-# Analysis driver is launched from a different location, be careful with relative paths in the driver
-# I bet there are more !!!!!!!!! expand

<b> Optional Keywords </b>

Optional keywords \c template_directory OR \c template_files are used to automate 
some of the file management that typically goes in the analysis drivers.

The other keywords modify the name, tagging, and saving of work directories, which
are analogous to the options that exist for parameters & results files.
