Perform each function evaluation in a separate working directory

Description::
When performing concurrent evaluations, it is typically necessary to
cloister simulation input and output files in separate directories to
avoid conflicts.  When the \c work_directory feature is enabled,
Dakota will create a directory for each evaluation, with optional
tagging (\c directory_tag) and saving (\c directory_save ), as with
files, and execute the analysis driver from that working directory.

The directory may be \c named with a string, or left anonymous to use
an automatically-generated directory in the system's temporary file
space, e.g., /tmp/dakota_work_c93vb71z/. The optional \c link_files
and \c copy_files keywords specify files or directories which should
appear in each working directory.
