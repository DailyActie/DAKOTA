Specify the order of the polynomial used in each Voronoi cell to construct the Voronoi surrogate
Description::
The Voronoi surrogate constructs many local emulators:  it 
constructs a separate polynomial regression surrogate in each Voronoi cell, based 
on the surrounding neighbors and the order of the polynomial specified. 
The \c surrogate_order specifies the order of the polynomial.  For example, order = 2 will 
generate all terms which have exponents that result in a sum of two or less.  For example, 
order = 2 in a 2-dimensional problem would generate terms of x1, x2, x1^2, x2^2, and x1x2.
