Blurb::
Evaluate points in the pattern until an improving point is found
Description::

In the \c nonblocking case, all points in the pattern may not be evaluated, 
since the first improving point found becomes the next iterate. Since 
the algorithm steps will be subject to parallel timing variabilities, 
these runs will not generally be repeatable.

In this release, both \c blocking and \c nonblocking specifications result 
in blocking behavior (except in the case where \c exporatory_moves is set 
to \c adaptive_pattern). Nonblocking behavior will be re-enabled after 
some underlying technical issues have been resolved.
