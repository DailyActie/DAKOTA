Experimental auto-refinement of surrogate model

Description::
(Experimental option) Automatically refine the surrogate model until
desired cross-validation quality is achieved.

<b> Default Behavior </b>

When \c auto_refinement is specified the surrogate will be refined to
a default tolerance of 1.0e-4 using the \c root_mean_square error
metric with 10-fold cross-validation.  Default maximum iterations and
function evaluations are 100 and 1000, respectively.
