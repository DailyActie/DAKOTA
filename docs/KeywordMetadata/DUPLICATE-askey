Select the Askey basis polynomials that match the basis random variable
Description::
The Askey option employs an extended basis of Hermite,
Legendre, Laguerre, Jacobi, and generalized Laguerre orthogonal
polynomials. 

- Askey polynomial selections include Hermite for normal (optimal) as 
 well as bounded normal, lognormal, bounded lognormal, gumbel, frechet, 
 and weibull (sub-optimal); Legendre for uniform (optimal) as well as
 loguniform, triangular, and bin-based histogram (sub-optimal);
 Laguerre for exponential (optimal); Jacobi for beta (optimal); and
 generalized Laguerre for gamma (optimal).
