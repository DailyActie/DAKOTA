Blurb:: Write a tabular results file with variable and response history

Description::
Specifying the \c tabular_graphics_data flag writes to a data file the
same variable and response function history data plotted when using
the \c graphics flag.  Within the generated data file, the variables
and response functions appear as columns and each function evaluation
provides a new table row. This capability is most useful for
post-processing of %Dakota results with third-party graphics tools
such as MatLab, Excel, Tecplot, etc.

There is no dependence between the \c graphics flag and the \c
tabular_graphics_data flag; they may be used independently or
concurrently.
