Blurb::
String (categorical) random variable defined by a histogram

Description::
This probability mass function is restricted to strings - meaning the
abscissa values must all be strings.  The \c n abscissa values are
paired with \c n \c counts which indicate the relative frequency
(mass) that the string will appear, relative to all other possible
strings.

Examples::
\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain = 2
 string
 pairs_per_variable = 2 3 
 abscissas =   'yes' 'no'   'function1' 'function2' 'function3'
 counts =      1     1      1           2           1
 descriptors = 'vote'       'which_function'
\endverbatim

Here there are two variables, the first one has two possible string values
which are equally probable.  The second one has three options, and
'function2' is twice as probable as 'function1' or 'function3'.
