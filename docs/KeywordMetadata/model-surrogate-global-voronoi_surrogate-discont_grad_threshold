Gradient threshold for discontinuity detection using Voronoi Piecewise Surrogate (VPS) 

Description:: 
VPS (Voronoi Piecewise Surrogate) models are used to construct high-dimensional surrogates fitting a few data points. The core idea in the VPS is to naturally decompose a high-dimensional domain into the corresponding implicit Voronoi tessellation, with the few given data points as Voronoi seeds. Each Voronoi cell the builds its own surrogate.  By specifying a gradient threshold between cells, it is possible to identify discontinuities with VPS:  discontinuituies are between cells that have a gradient greater than the gradient threshold.
