Compute metrics of surrogate quality
Description::
A variety of diagnostic metrics are available to assess the
goodness of fit of a global surrogate to its training data.

The default diagnostics are:
\li \c sum_squared
\li \c mean_squared
\li \croot_mean_squared
\li \c sum_abs
\li \c mean_abs
\li \c max_abs
\li \c rsquared

Additional metrics can be activated using the keywords \c press
and \c cross_validate.

Theory::
Most of these diagnostics refer to some operation on the
residuals (the difference between the surrogate model and the truth
model at the data points upon which the surrogate is built).

For
example, \c sum_squared refers to the sum of the squared residuals,
and \c mean_abs refers to the mean of the absolute value of the
residuals. \c rsquared refers to the R-squared value typically used
in regression analysis (the proportion of the variability in the
response that can be accounted for by the surrogate model). Care
should be taken when interpreting metrics, for example, errors may be
near zero for interpolatory models or rsquared may not be applicable
for non-polynomial models.

Faq::
Are the default diagnostics correct? Actually, this behavior is not in the ref man at all, so I just made this page up.
