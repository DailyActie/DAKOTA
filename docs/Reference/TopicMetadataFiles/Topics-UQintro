%Dakota provides a variety of methods for propagating uncertainty.
Aleatory uncertainty refers to inherent variability, irreducible
uncertainty, or randomness, and is addressed with the probabilistic
methods described in \ref MethodNonDAleat.  Epistemic uncertainty
refers to subjective uncertainty, reducible uncertainty, model form
uncertainty, or uncertainty due to lack of knowledge, and is addressed
using the non-probabilistic approaches described in \ref
MethodNonDEpist.  In general, we refer to both classes of uncertainty
quantification methods in %Dakota as nondeterministic methods.  In the
descriptions below, we described the issues and specification controls
that are common to both aleatory and epistemic uncertainty
quantification.

%Dakota's nondeterministic methods make use of a few method independent
controls.  \c max_iterations and \c convergence_tolerance are used by
iterated local and global reliability, stochastic expansions undergoing
automated refinement, and optimization-based epistemic methods.  \c
output level controls are also employed by several methods:
<ul>
<li> optional output of probability density functions (PDFs), for 
settings of \c normal or higher (sampling methods, including numerical
statistics for stochastic expansion methods)</li>
<li> optional output of sample evaluations performed on approximations,
for settings of \c verbose or higher (stochastic expansion methods)</li>
<li> optional tabular output of numerical integration points and weights,
for settings of \c verbose or higher (stochastic expansion methods)</li>
<li> optional output of local sensitivities computed from global 
approximations, for settings of \c normal or higher (stochastic 
expansion methods)</li>
<li> optional output of statistical quantities of interest (QOI) for 
iterations prior to convergence of an automated refinement process 
(stochastic expansion methods with a \c debug setting)</li>
</ul>
<!-- Only the \c x_taylor_mpp, \c u_taylor_mpp, \c x_two_point, and \c
u_two_point methods within \c local_reliability use method independent
convergence controls (see \ref MethodNonDLocalRel).  As such, the
nondeterministic branch documentation which follows is primarily
limited to the method dependent controls for the sampling,
reliability, stochastic expansion, and epistemic methods. -->

Each of the uncertainty quantification techniques is standardized on
support for \c response_levels, \c probability_levels, \c
reliability_levels, and \c gen_reliability_levels specifications along
with their optional \c num_response_levels, \c num_probability_levels,
\c num_reliability_levels and \c num_gen_reliability_levels keys,
except for a few exceptions where certain level mappings cannot be
supported: \c global_reliability, \c importance, \c local_evidence,
and \c global_evidence do not support mappings involving \c
reliability_levels, and \c local_interval_est and \c
global_interval_est do not support any level mappings.  The keys
define the distribution of the levels among the different response
functions.  For example, the following specification
\verbatim
	num_response_levels = 2 4 3
	response_levels = 1. 2. .1 .2 .3 .4 10. 20. 30.
\endverbatim
would assign the first two response levels (1., 2.) to response
function 1, the next four response levels (.1, .2, .3, .4) to response
function 2, and the final three response levels (10., 20., 30.) to
response function 3.  If the \c num_response_levels key were omitted
from this example, then the response levels would be evenly distributed 
among the response functions (three levels each in this case).

The \c response_levels specification provides the target response
values for generating probabilities, reliabilities, or generalized
reliabilities (forward mapping).  The selection among these possible
results for the forward mapping is performed with the \c compute
keyword followed by either \c probabilities, \c reliabilities, or \c
gen_reliabilities.  For example, specifying a \c response_level of
52.3 followed with \c compute \c probabilities will result in the
calculation that the (uncertain) output value is less than or equal to
52.3, given the uncertain distributions on the inputs.  Conversely,
the \c probability_levels, \c reliability_levels, and \c
gen_reliability_levels specifications provide target levels for which
response values will be computed (inverse mapping).  For example,
specifying a \c probability_level of 0.95 will result in the
calculation of a response value which corresponds to the 95th
percentile of the output distribution.  Specifications of \c
response_levels, \c probability_levels, \c reliability_levels, and \c
gen_reliability_levels may be combined within the calculations for
each response function.  The mapping results (probabilities,
reliabilities, or generalized reliabilities for the forward mapping
and response values for the inverse mapping) define the final
statistics of the nondeterministic analysis that can be accessed for
use at a higher level (via the primary and secondary mapping matrices
for nested models; see \ref ModelNested).

Sets of response-probability pairs computed with the forward/inverse
mappings define either a cumulative distribution function (CDF) or a
complementary cumulative distribution function (CCDF) for each
response function.  In the case of evidence-based epistemic methods,
this is generalized to define either cumulative belief and
plausibility functions (CBF and CPF) or complementary cumulative
belief and plausibility functions (CCBF and CCPF) for each response
function, where a forward mapping involves computing the belief and
plausibility probability level for a specified response level and an
inverse mapping involves computing the belief and plausibility
response level for either a specified probability level or a specified
generalized reliability level (two results for each level mapping in
the evidence-based epistemic case, instead of the one result for each
level mapping in the aleatory case).  The selection of a CDF/CBF/CPF
or CCDF/CCBF/CCPF can be performed with the \c distribution keyword
followed by either \c cumulative for the CDF/CBF/CPF option or \c
complementary for the CCDF/CCBF/CCPF option.  This selection also
defines the sign of the reliability or generalized reliability
indices.  

Different nondeterministic methods have differing support for
uncertain variable distributions. Tables \ref T5d29 "5.29", \ref 
T5d30 "5.30", and \ref T5d31 "5.31" summarize the uncertain variables
that are available for use by the different methods, where a "-"
indicates that the distribution is not supported by the method, a "U"
means the uncertain input variables of this type must be uncorrelated,
a "C" denotes that correlations are supported involving uncertain
input variables of this type, and an "A" means the appropriate 
variables must be specified as active in the variables 
specification block.  For example, if one wants to support 
sampling or a stochastic expansion method over both 
continuous uncertain and continuous state variables, the 
specification \c active \c all must be listed in the variables 
specification block. 
Additional notes include:
- we have four variants for stochastic expansions (SE), listed as
  Wiener, Askey, Extended, and Piecewise which draw from different sets 
  of basis polynomials.  The term stochastic expansion indicates polynomial 
  chaos and stochastic collocation collectively, although the Piecewise 
  option is only currently supported for stochastic collocation.  Refer to 
  \ref MethodNonDPCE and \ref MethodNonDSC for additional information on 
  these three options.  
- methods supporting the epistemic interval distributions have differing
  approaches: \c sampling and the \c lhs option of \c 
  global_interval_est model the interval basic probability
  assignments (BPAs) as continuous histogram bin distributions for
  purposes of generating samples; \c local_interval_est and the 
  \c ego option of \c global_interval_est ignore the BPA details 
  and models these variables as simple bounded regions defined by the 
  cell extremes; and \c local_evidence and \c global_evidence
  model the interval specifications as true BPAs.

<!-- could go into more detail on sub-options of local/global evidence, 
     but I think that's probably overkill. -->
<!-- and a "C#" denotes that correlations are only supported between 
variables of this type and other variables in the same numbered set. -->
