Aleatory uncertainty is also known as inherent variability,
irreducible uncertainty, or randomness.  An example of aleatory
uncertainty is the distribution of height in a population, as it is
characterized by the availability of sufficient data to accurately
model the form of the variation.  For this reason, aleatory
uncertainty is typically modeled using probabilistic approaches
through the specification of probability distributions to represent
the uncertain input variables and the propagation of this uncertainty
using probability theory.  The probabilistic approaches supported in
%Dakota include sampling, local and global reliability, polynomial
chaos, and stochastic collocation, which may be used to propagate
random variables described by \ref VarCAUV_Normal, \ref VarCAUV_Lognormal,
