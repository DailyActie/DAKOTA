This page discusses discrete state and design variables. 
The uncertain variables are described on the variable
keyword pages.

There are currently three ways to specify a discrete 
state or design variable:
-# Set of integers
-# Set of reals
-# Range

<b> Sets </b>

Sets of integers and reals are basically the same, except
that one of them is restricted to integer values.

Specifying a set requires three keywords:
- Variable declaration keyword - specifies the number of variables being defined
- \c num_set_values - a list of positive integers specifying how many members each variable contains
  - Length = # of variables
- \c set_values - a list of the permissable integer values in ALL sets, concatenated together.
  - Length = sum of \c num_set_values
  - The order is very important here.
  - The list is partitioned according to the values of \c num_set_values, and each partition is assigned to a variable.
- The ordering of \c num_set_values, and the partitions of \c set_values must match the strings from \c descriptions

Examples are given on the pages:
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set_integer
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set_real 

<b> Range </b>

For discrete range variables, the \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds restrict the size of the feasible design space and are frequently used to prevent nonphysical designs. 
This is a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).
