The OPT++ library [\ref MeOlHoWi07 "Meza et al., 2007"] contains primarily
gradient-based nonlinear programming optimizers for unconstrained,
bound-constrained, and nonlinearly constrained minimization:
Polak-Ribiere conjugate gradient (%Dakota's \c optpp_cg method),
quasi-Newton (%Dakota's \c optpp_q_newton method), finite difference
Newton (%Dakota's \c optpp_fd_newton method), and full Newton (%Dakota's
\c optpp_newton method).  The conjugate gradient method is strictly
unconstrained, and each of the Newton-based methods are automatically
bound to the appropriate OPT++ algorithm based on the user constraint
specification (unconstrained, bound-constrained, or
generally-constrained).  In the generally-constrained case, the Newton
methods use a nonlinear interior-point approach to manage the
constraints.  The library also contains a direct search algorithm, PDS
(parallel direct search, %Dakota's \c optpp_pds method), which supports
bound constraints.
