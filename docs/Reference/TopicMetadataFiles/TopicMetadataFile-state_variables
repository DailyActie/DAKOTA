State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
tolerances, and time step controls. 

Only parameter studies and design of experiments 
methods will iterate on state variables.

The \c initial_state is used as the only value
for the state variable for all other methods, unless \c active
\c state is invoked.
