When performing interval analysis, 
one assumes that nothing is known about
an epistemic uncertain variable except that its value lies
somewhere within an interval. The goal of uncertainty quantification 
in this context is to determine the 
resulting bounds on the output (defining the output interval)
given interval bounds on the inputs.
