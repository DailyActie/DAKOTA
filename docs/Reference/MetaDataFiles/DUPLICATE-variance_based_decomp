Global sensitivity analyis using variance-based decomposition
Description::
Dakota can calculate sensitivity indices through variance based
decomposition using the keyword \c variance_based_decomp. 
These indicate how important the uncertainty in each input 
variable is in contributing to the output variance.

Because of the
computational cost, \c variance_based_decomp is turned off as a
default.

Theory::
In this context, we take
sensitivity analysis to be global, not local as when calculating
derivatives of output variables with respect to input variables. Our
definition is similar to that of [\ref Saltelli2004 "Saltelli et al., 2004"]: 
"The study of how uncertainty in the output of a model can be 
apportioned to different sources of uncertainty in the model input."

Variance 
based decomposition is a way of using sets of samples to understand
how the variance of the output behaves, with respect to each input
variable. A larger value of the sensitivity index, \f$S_i\f$, means 
that the uncertainty in the input variable i has a larger effect on 
the variance of the output. More details on the calculations and
interpretation of the sensitivity indices can be found in [\ref
Saltelli2004 "Saltelli et al., 2004"] and 
[\ref Weirs2010 "Weirs et al., 2010"]. Note that \c
variance_based_decomp is extremely computationally intensive since
replicated sets of sample values are evaluated. If the user specified
a number of samples, N, and a number of nondeterministic variables, M,
variance-based decomposition requires the evaluation of N*(M+2)
samples. To obtain sensitivity indices that are reasonably accurate,
we recommend that N, the number of samples, be at least one hundred
and preferably several hundred or thousands.
