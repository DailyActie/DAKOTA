Balance goals of reducing objective function and satisfying constraints
Description::
A \c merit_function is a
function in constrained optimization that attempts to provide joint
progress toward reducing the objective function and satisfying the
constraints. 

<!-- MSE/PDH: option retired on 12/14/2012 as OPT++ hardwires this
   	   internally to match merit_function.
The \c central_path specification represents a measure of proximity to
the central path and specifies an update strategy for the perturbation
parameter mu. Refer to [\ref Argaez2002 "Argaez et al., 2002"] for a
detailed discussion on proximity measures to the central region. Valid
options are, again, \c el_bakry, \c argaez_tapia, or \c van_shanno.
The default value for \c central_path is the value of \c
merit_function (either user-selected or default). -->
