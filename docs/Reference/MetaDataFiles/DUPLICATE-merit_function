Balance goals of reducing objective function and satisfying constraints
Description::
A \c merit_function is a
function in constrained optimization that attempts to provide joint
progress toward reducing the objective function and satisfying the
constraints. Valid options are \c el_bakry, \c argaez_tapia, or \c
van_shanno, where user input is not case sensitive in this case.
Details for these selections are as follows:

\li The "el_bakry" merit function is the L2-norm of the first order
optimality conditions for the nonlinear programming problem. The cost
per linesearch iteration is n+1 function evaluations. For more
information, see [\ref ElBak1996 "El-Bakry et al., 1996"].
 
\li The "argaez_tapia" merit function can be classified as a modified
augmented Lagrangian function. The augmented Lagrangian is modified
by adding to its penalty term a potential reduction function to handle
the perturbed complementarity condition. The cost per linesearch
iteration is one function evaluation. For more information, see
[\ref Tapia1 "Tapia and Argaez"].

\li The "van_shanno" merit function can be classified as a penalty
function for the logarithmic barrier formulation of the nonlinear
programming problem. The cost per linesearch iteration is one
function evaluation. For more information see 
[\ref VanShanno1999 "Vanderbei and Shanno, 1999"].

If the function evaluation is expensive or noisy, set the \c
merit_function to "argaez_tapia" or "van_shanno".

<!-- MSE/PDH: option retired on 12/14/2012 as OPT++ hardwires this
   	   internally to match merit_function.
The \c central_path specification represents a measure of proximity to
the central path and specifies an update strategy for the perturbation
parameter mu. Refer to [\ref Argaez2002 "Argaez et al., 2002"] for a
detailed discussion on proximity measures to the central region. Valid
options are, again, \c el_bakry, \c argaez_tapia, or \c van_shanno.
The default value for \c central_path is the value of \c
merit_function (either user-selected or default). -->
