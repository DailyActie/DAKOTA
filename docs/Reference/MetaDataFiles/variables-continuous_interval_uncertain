Epistemic uncertain variable - continuous values within one or more intervals
Description::
The continuous interval uncertain variable is NOT a probability distribution. Although it may seem similar to a histogram, the interpretation of this uncertain variable is different. It is used in epistemic uncertainty analysis, where one is trying to model uncertainty due to lack of knowledge. 

In %Dakota, epistemic uncertainty analysis is performed using either interval estimation or Dempster-Shafer theory of evidence. 
In these approaches, one does not assign a probability distribution to each uncertain input variable.
Rather, one divides each uncertain input variable into one or more intervals. The input parameters are only known to occur within intervals; nothing more is assumed. 

Each interval is defined by its upper and lower bounds, and a Basic Probability Assignment (BPA) associated with that interval. The BPA represents a probability of that uncertain variable being located within that interval. 
The intervals and BPAs are used to construct uncertainty measures on the outputs called "belief" and "plausibility." 
Belief represents the smallest possible probability that is consistent with the evidence, while plausibility represents the largest possible probability that is consistent with the evidence. For more information about these approaches, refer to \ref MethodNonDEpist. 

As an example, in the following specification:
\verbatim
continuous_interval_uncertain = 2
 num_intervals = 3 2
 interval_probs = 0.2 0.5 0.3 0.4 0.6
 lower_bounds = 2.0 4.0 4.5 1.0 3.0
 upper_bounds = 2.5 5.0 6.0 5.0 5.0
\endverbatim

there are 2 interval uncertain variables. The first one is defined by three intervals, and the second by two intervals. The three intervals for the first variable have basic probability assignments of 0.2, 0.5, and 0.3, respectively, while the basic probability assignments for the two intervals for the second variable are 0.4 and 0.6. 
The basic probability assignments for each interval variable must sum to one. The interval bounds for the first variable are [2, 2.5], [4, 5], and [4.5, 6], and the interval bounds for the second variable are [1.0, 5.0] and [3.0, 5.0]. Note that the intervals can be overlapping or disjoint.
