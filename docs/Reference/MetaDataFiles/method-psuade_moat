The Problem Solving Environment for Uncertainty Analysis and Design
Exploration (PSUADE) is a Lawrence Livermore National Laboratory tool
for metamodeling, sensitivity analysis, uncertainty quantification,
and optimization. Its features include non-intrusive and parallel
function evaluations, sampling and analysis methods, an integrated
design and analysis framework, global optimization, numerical
integration, response surfaces (MARS and higher order regressions),
graphical output with Pgplot or Matlab, and fault tolerance [\ref
Tong2005 "C.H. Tong, 2005"].

The Morris One-At-A-Time (MOAT) method, originally proposed by Morris
[\ref Morris1991 "M.D. Morris, 1991"], is a screening method, designed
to explore a computational model to distinguish between input
variables that have negligible, linear and additive, or nonlinear or
interaction effects on the output. The computer experiments performed
consist of individually randomized designs which vary one input factor
at a time to create a sample of its elementary effects. The PSUADE
implementation of MOAT is selected with method keyword \c psuade_moat.
The number of samples (\c samples) must be a positive integer multiple
of (number of continuous design variable + 1) and will be
automatically adjusted if misspecified. The number of partitions (\c
partitions) applies to each variable being studied and must be odd
(the number of MOAT levels per variable is partitions + 1). This will
also be adjusted at runtime as necessary. For information on
practical use of this method, see 
[\ref Saltelli2004 "Saltelli, et al., 2004"].
