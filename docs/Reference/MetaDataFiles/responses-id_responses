Give the block a name, in case of multiple responses blocks
Description::
The optional set identifier specification uses the keyword \c
id_responses to input a string for use in identifying a particular
responses specification. A model can then identify the use of this
response set by specifying the same string in its \c responses_pointer
specification (see \ref ModelIndControl). For example, a model whose
specification contains <tt>responses_pointer = 'R1'</tt> will use a
responses set with <tt>id_responses = 'R1'</tt>.

If the \c id_responses specification is omitted, a particular
responses specification will be used by a model only if that model
omits specifying a \c responses_pointer and if the responses set was
the last set parsed (or is the only set parsed). In common practice,
if only one responses set exists, then \c id_responses can be safely
omitted from the responses specification and \c responses_pointer can
be omitted from the model specification(s), since there is no
potential for ambiguity in this case.
