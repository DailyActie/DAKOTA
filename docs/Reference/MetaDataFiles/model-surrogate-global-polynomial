Linear, Quadratic, and Cubic Polynomial Models

Description::
Linear, quadratic, and cubic polynomial models are available in
Dakota. The form of the linear polynomial model is

\begin{equation}
 \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx c_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}x_{i}
 \label{models:surf:equation01}
\end{equation}

the form of the quadratic polynomial model is:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx c_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}x_{i}
 +\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j \ge i}^{n}c_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}
 \label{models:surf:equation02}
\end{equation}

and the form of the cubic polynomial model is:

\begin{equation}
 \hat{f}(\mathbf{x}) \approx c_{0}+\sum_{i=1}^{n}c_{i}x_{i}
 +\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j \ge i}^{n}c_{ij}x_{i}x_{j}
 +\sum_{i=1}^{n}\sum_{j \ge i}^{n}\sum_{k \ge j}^{n}
 c_{ijk}x_{i}x_{j}x_{k}
 \label{models:surf:equation03}
\end{equation}

In all of the polynomial models, $\hat{f}(\mathbf{x})$ is the response
of the polynomial model; the $x_{i},x_{j},x_{k}$ terms are the
components of the $n$-dimensional design parameter values; the $c_{0}$
, $c_{i}$ , $c_{ij}$ , $c_{ijk} $ terms are the polynomial
coefficients, and $n$ is the number of design parameters. The number
of coefficients, $n_{c}$, depends on the order of polynomial model and
the number of design parameters. For the linear polynomial:

\begin{equation}
 n_{c_{linear}}=n+1
 \label{models:surf:equation04}
\end{equation}

for the quadratic polynomial:

\begin{equation}
 n_{c_{quad}}=\frac{(n+1)(n+2)}{2}
 \label{models:surf:equation05}
\end{equation}

and for the cubic polynomial:

\begin{equation}
 n_{c_{cubic}}=\frac{(n^{3}+6 n^{2}+11 n+6)}{6}
 \label{models:surf:equation06}
\end{equation}

There must be at least $n_{c}$ data samples in order to form a fully
determined linear system and solve for the polynomial coefficients. In
Dakota, a least-squares approach involving a singular value
decomposition numerical method is applied to solve the linear system.

The utility of the polynomial models stems from two sources: (1) over
a small portion of the parameter space, a low-order polynomial model
is often an accurate approximation to the true data trends, and (2)
the least-squares procedure provides a surface fit that smooths out
noise in the data. For this reason, the surrogate-based optimization
strategy often is successful when using polynomial models,
particularly quadratic models. However, a polynomial surface fit may
not be the best choice for modeling data trends over the entire
parameter space, unless it is known a priori that the true data trends
are close to linear, quadratic, or cubic. See \ref{Mye95} for more
information on polynomial models.
