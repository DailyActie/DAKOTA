Description::
The
command \c constraint_relax followed by a method name specifies the
type of relaxation to be used. Currently, \c homotopy [\ref Perez2004
"Perez et al., 2004"] is the only available method for constraint
relaxation, and this method is dependent on the presence of the NPSOL
library within the %Dakota executable.
