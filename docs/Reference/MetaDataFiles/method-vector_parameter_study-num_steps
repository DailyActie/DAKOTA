Select the number of sampling steps along the vector
Description::
\c num_steps defines the number of steps that are taken in the 
direction of the vector. The magnitude of each step is determined
in conjuction with the rest of the method specification.

This study performs function evaluations at
both ends, making the total number of evaluations equal to \c
num_steps+1. 

The study has stringent requirements on performing
appropriate steps with any discrete range and discrete set variables.
A \c num_steps specification must result in discrete range and set
index steps that are integers: no remainder is currently permitted in
the integer step calculation and no rounding to integer steps will
occur.
