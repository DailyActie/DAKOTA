Description:: The use of a scaling factor in the proposal covariance.  This scales the proposal covariance and may be useful when the input variables being calibrated are of different magnitudes:  one may want to take a larger step in a direction with a larger magnitude, for example.  The proposal covariance is a list of reals, one for each variable.
