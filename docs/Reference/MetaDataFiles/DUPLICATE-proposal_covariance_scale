Scale the proposal covariance matrix
Description::
The use of a scaling factor in the proposal covariance. The proposal jumps are sampled from a multivariate normal distribution !!!!!!!!!! HOW IS THE COV matrix formed??? !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!. 

This scales the values on the diagonal of the proposal covariance and may be useful when the input variables being calibrated are of different magnitudes: one may want to take a larger step in a direction with a larger magnitude, for example. The proposal covariance is a list of reals, one for each variable.
