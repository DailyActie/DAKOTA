Squential Quadratic Program
Description::
The NLPQL library is a commercially-licensed library containing a
sequential quadratic programming (SQP) optimizer, specified as
%Dakota's \c nlpql_sqp method, for constrained optimization. The
particular implementation used is NLPQLP 
[\ref Schitt2004 "Schittkowski, 2004"], a variant with distributed 
and non-monotone line search.  %Dakota provides access to the NLPQL 
library through the NLPQLPOptimizer class.

The method independent controls for maximum iterations and output
verbosity are mapped to NLPQL controls MAXIT and IPRINT, respectively.
The maximum number of function evaluations is enforced within the
NLPQLPOptimizer class.
