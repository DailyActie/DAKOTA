Specify generalized relability levels at which to estimate the corresponding response value
Description::
This is used in many contexts, including:
 -# ummm
 -# err..
Response levels are calculated for
specified generalized reliabilities by
indexing into a sorted samples array (the response levels computed are
not interpolated and will correspond to one of the sampled values).
