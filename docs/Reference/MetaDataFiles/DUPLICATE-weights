Apply different weights to each response
Description::
If the response type is either \c objective_functions or \c calibration_terms,
and the number of responses is 
greater than 1, then a \c weights specification
provides a simple weighted-sum approach to combining multiple
objectives: \f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} w_{i}f_{i}\f] If this is not
specified, then each response is given equal weighting: 
\f[f = \sum_{i=1}^{n} \frac{f_i}{n}\f] where, in both of these cases, a
"minimization" sense will retain a positive weighting for a minimizer
and a "maximization" sense will apply a negative weighting. If
scaling is specified, it is applied before multi-objective weighted
sums are formed.
