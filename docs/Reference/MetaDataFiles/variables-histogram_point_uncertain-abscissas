Description::
Within the histogram point uncertain optional group specification, the
number of histogram point uncertain variables is a required
specification, the number of pairs is an optional key for
apportionment of abscissas and counts, the sets of abscissas and
counts are required, and the variable descriptors are optional. When
using a histogram point variable, one must define at least one set of
abscissa/count pairs.  As for \ref VarCAUV_Bin_Histogram, the \c
abscissas specifications define abscissa values ("x" coordinates) for
the PDF of each histogram variable.  When paired with \c counts, the
specifications provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each histogram
variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency or relative
probability) associated with a point.

To fully specify a point-based histogram with \c n points, \c n
\c (x,c) pairs (note that \c (x,c) and \c (x,y) are equivalent in this
case) must be specified with the following features:

\li \c x is the point value and \c c is the corresponding count 
    for that value.
\li the \c x values must be strictly increasing.
\li all \c c values must be positive.
\li a minimum of one pair must be specified for each point-based histogram.
