Reuse the same seed value for multiple sampling sets
Description::
The \c
fixed_seed flag is relevant if multiple sampling sets will be
generated during the course of a strategy (e.g., surrogate-based
optimization, optimization under uncertainty). 

Specifying this keyword
results in the reuse of the same seed value for each of these multiple
sampling sets, which can be important for reducing variability in the
sampling results. 

However, this behavior is not the default as the
repetition of the same sampling pattern can result in a modeling
weakness that an optimizer could potentially exploit (resulting in
actual reliabilities that are lower than the estimated reliabilities).
In either case (\c fixed_seed or not), the study is repeatable if the
user specifies a \c seed and the study is random is the user omits a
\c seed specification.
