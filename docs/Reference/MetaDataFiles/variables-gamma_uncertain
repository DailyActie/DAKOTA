Specify a random variable with a gamma distribution
Description::
The gamma distribution is sometimes used to model time to complete a task, such as a repair or service task. It is a very flexible distribution. Within the gamma uncertain optional group specification, the number of gamma uncertain variables and the alpha and beta parameters are required specifications, and variable descriptors is an optional specification.

The density function for the gamma distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{{x}^{\alpha-1}{e}^{\frac{-x}{\beta}}}{\beta^{\alpha}\Gamma(\alpha)}\f]
where 
\f$\mu_{GA} = \alpha\beta\f$ and \f$\sigma^2_{GA} = \alpha\beta^2\f$. 
Note that the exponential distribution is a special
case of this distribution for parameter \f$\alpha = 1\f$.
