Blurb::
Analysis driver will return gradients
Description::
The gradient specification must be one of four types: 1) no gradients,
2) numerical gradients, 3) analytic gradients, or 4) mixed gradients.

The \c analytic_gradients specification means that gradient
information is available directly from the simulation (finite
differencing is not required). The simulation must return the gradient
data in the %Dakota format (enclosed in single brackets; see %Dakota
File Data Formats in the Users Manual [\ref UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"]) 
for the case of file transfer of data. The \c analytic_gradients keyword 
is a complete specification for this case.
