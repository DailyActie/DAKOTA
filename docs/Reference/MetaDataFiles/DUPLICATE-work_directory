Have Dakota set up working directories before launching analysis driver
Description::
When performing concurrent evaluations and/or analyses, it is often
necessary to cloister input and output files in separate directories
to avoid conflicts. When the \c work_directory feature is enabled,
%Dakota will create a directory for each evaluation/analysis (with
optional tagging and saving as with files), and execute the analysis
driver from that working directory. If an optional \c
template_directory and/or list of \c template_files is specified,
%Dakota will link (or copy) those files into each working
directory.
