Aleatory uncertain discrete variable - Poisson
Description::
The Poisson distribution is used to predict the number of discrete events that happen in a given time interval.  The expected number of occurences in the time interval is \f$\lambda\f$, which must be a positive real number.  For example, if events occur on average 4 times per year and we are interested in the distribution of events over six months, \f$\lambda\f$ would be 2 in this case.  However, if we were interested in the distribution of events occuring over 5 years, \f$\lambda\f$ would be 20.
 
The density function for the poisson distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\lambda e^{-\lambda}}{x!}\f] 
where \f$\lambda\f$ is the frequency of events happening, and \c x is the number of events that occur. 
The poisson distribution returns samples representing number of occurrences in the time period of interest.

Theory::
When used with design of experiments and multidimensional parameter
studies, distribution bounds are inferred.
These bounds are [0, \f$\mu + 3 \sigma\f$].

For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.
