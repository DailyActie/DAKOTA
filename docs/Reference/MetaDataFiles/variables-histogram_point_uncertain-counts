Distribution parameter for the histogram point distribution 
Description::
When using a histogram point variable, one must define at least one set of
abscissa/count pairs.   The \c
abscissas  define abscissa values ("x" coordinates) for
the PDF of each histogram variable.  These are  paired with \c counts which
provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each histogram
variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency)
associated with a point.

To fully specify a point-based histogram with \c n points, \c n
\c (x,c) pairs   must be specified with the following features:

\li \c x is the point value and \c c is the corresponding count 
    for that value.
\li the \c x values must be strictly increasing.
\li all \c c values must be positive.
\li a minimum of one pair must be specified for each point-based histogram.
