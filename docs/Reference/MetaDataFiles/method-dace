Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments
Description::
Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DACE) methods compute
response data sets at a selection of points in the parameter space.
Three libraries are provided for performing these studies: DDACE, 
FSUDace, and PSUADE. The design of experiments methods do not
currently make use of any of the method independent controls.

The Distributed Design and Analysis of Computer Experiments (DDACE)
library provides the following DACE techniques: grid sampling (\c
grid), pure random sampling (\c random), orthogonal array sampling (\c
oas), latin hypercube sampling (\c lhs), orthogonal array latin
hypercube sampling (\c oa_lhs), Box-Behnken (\c box_behnken), and
central composite design (\c central_composite). It is worth noting
that there is some overlap in sampling techniques with those available
from the nondeterministic branch. The current distinction is that the
nondeterministic branch methods are designed to sample within a
variety of probability distributions for uncertain variables, whereas
the design of experiments methods treat all variables as having
uniform distributions. As such, the design of experiments methods are
well-suited for performing parametric studies and for generating data
sets used in building global approximations (see \ref ModelSurrG),
but are not currently suited for assessing the effect of
uncertainties. If a design of experiments over both design/state
variables (treated as uniform) and uncertain variables (with
probability distributions) is desired, then \c sampling can
support this with \c active \c all specified in the Variables 
specification block.

In terms of method dependent controls, the specification structure is
straightforward. First, there is a set of design of experiments
algorithm selections separated by logical OR's (\c grid or \c random
or \c oas or \c lhs or \c oa_lhs or \c box_behnken or \c
central_composite). Second, there are optional specifications for the
random seed to use in generating the sample set (\c seed), for fixing
the seed (\c fixed_seed) among multiple sample sets (see \ref
MethodNonDMC for discussion), for the number of samples to perform (\c
samples), and for the number of symbols to use (\c symbols). The \c
seed control is used to make sample sets repeatable, and the \c
symbols control is related to the number of replications in the sample
set (a larger number of symbols equates to more stratification and
fewer replications). The \c main_effects control prints Analysis-of-Variance
main effects results (e.g. ANOVA tables with p-values per variable). 
The \c main_effects control is only operational with the 
orthogonal arrays or Latin Hypercube designs, not for Box Behnken or 
Central Composite designs. The \c quality_metrics control is available 
for the DDACE library. 
This control turns on calculation of volumetric quality measures 
which measure the uniformity of the point samples. 
More details on the quality measures are given under the description of the 
FSU sampling methods. The \c variance_based_decomp control is also 
available. This control enables the calculation of sensitivity 
indices which indicate how important the uncertainty in each input 
variable is in contributing to the output variance. More details 
on variance based decomposition are given in \ref MethodNonDMC.
