Specify which model block will be iterated upon by the method
Description::
The model pointer string is specified with \c model_pointer and is used to identify the model used to perform function evaluations for the method. 
If a model pointer string is specified and no corresponding id is available, %Dakota will exit with an error message. If no model pointer string is specified, then the last model specification parsed will be used. 
If no model pointer string is specified and no model specification is provided by the user, then a default model specification is used (similar to the default strategy specification, see \ref StratDescr). 
This default model specification is of type \c single with no \c variables_pointer, \c interface_pointer, or \c responses_pointer (see \ref ModelSingle). 
It is appropriate to omit a model specification whenever the relationships are unambiguous due to the presence of single variables, interface, and responses specifications.
