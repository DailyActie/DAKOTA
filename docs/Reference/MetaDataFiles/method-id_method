Blurb::
Give the block a name, in case of multiple method blocks
Description::
The method identifier string is supplied with \c id_method and is used
to provide a unique identifier string for use with strategy
specifications (refer to \ref StratDescr). It is appropriate to omit a
method identifier string if only one method is included in the input
file and \c single_method is the selected strategy (all other
strategies require one or more method pointers), since the single
method to use is unambiguous in this case.
