A conjugate gradient optimization method
Description::
The DOT library 
[\ref Vrand1995 "Vanderplaats Research and Development, 1995"] 
contains nonlinear programming optimizers, specifically the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (%Dakota's \c dot_bfgs method) and
Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient (%Dakota's \c dot_frcg method)
methods for unconstrained optimization, and the modified method of
feasible directions (%Dakota's \c dot_mmfd method), sequential linear
programming (%Dakota's \c dot_slp method), and sequential quadratic
programming (%Dakota's \c dot_sqp method) methods for constrained
optimization. %Dakota provides access to the DOT library through the
DOTOptimizer class.

We here provide a caution regarding \c dot_frcg.  In DOT
Version 4.20, we have noticed inconsistent behavior of this algorithm
across different versions of Linux.  Our best assessment is that it is
due to different treatments of uninitialized variables.  As we do not
know the intention of the code authors and maintaining DOT source code
is outside of the %Dakota project scope, we have not made nor are we
recommending any code changes to address this.  However, all users who
use \c dot_frcg in DOT Version 4.20 should be aware that
results may not be reliable.

This is a duplicate. why is this here? see \ref method-dot-frcg
