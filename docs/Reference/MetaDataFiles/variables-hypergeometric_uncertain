Aleatory uncertain discrete variable - hypergeometric
Description::
The hypergeometric distribution is used to define the number of failures (or the number of successes; the number of some type of event) in a set of tests that has a known proportion of failures. The hypergeometric is often described using an urn model. For example, say we have a total population containing N balls, and we know that m of the balls are white and the remaining balls are green. If we draw n balls from the urn without replacement, the hypergeometric distribution describes the distribution of the number of white balls drawn from the urn. 
 
The density function for the hypergeometric distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}m\\x\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{N-m}\\{n-x}\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}N\\n\end{array}\right)}\f] 
where N is the total population, m is the number of items in the selected population (e.g. the number of white balls in the full urn of N items), and n is the number of balls drawn.
