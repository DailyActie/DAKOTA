Distribution parameter
Description::
The density function for the hypergeometric distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{\left(\begin{array}{c}m\\x\end{array}\right)\left(\begin{array}{c}{N-m}\\{n-x}\end{array}\right)}{\left(\begin{array}{c}N\\n\end{array}\right)}\f] 
where N is the total population, m is the number of items in the selected population (e.g. the number of white balls in the full urn of N items), and n is the number of balls drawn.
