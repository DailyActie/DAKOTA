Specify which reponses block will be included with this model block
Description::
Each of these model specifications supports \c variables_pointer and \c responses_pointer strings for identifying the variables and responses specifications used in constructing the model (by cross-referencing with \c id_variables and \c id_responses strings from particular variables and responses keyword specifications). 
These pointers are valid for each model type since each model contains a set of variables that is mapped into a set of responses -- only the specifics of the mapping differ. 
Additional pointers are used for each model type for constructing the components of the variable to response mapping. 
As the environment specification identifies the top level method and a method specification identifies a model, a model specification identifies variables, responses, and (for some types) interface specifications. This top-down flow specifies all of the object interrelationships.

For each of these pointer specifications, if a pointer string is specified and no corresponding id string is available, %Dakota will exit with an error message. 
If the pointer is optional and no pointer string is specified, then the last specification parsed will be used. 
It is appropriate to omit optional cross-referencing whenever the relationships are unambiguous due to the presence of only one specification.
