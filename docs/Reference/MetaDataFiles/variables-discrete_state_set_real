Blurb::
Discrete state variables, each defined by a set of permissible real numbers
Description::
The \c initial_state specifications
provide the initial values for the state variables which will be
passed through to the simulator (e.g., in order to define
parameterized modeling controls). 

Topics::	discrete_variable, state_variable, not_yet_reviewed
Examples::
Theory::
State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
tolerances, and time step controls.
