Epistemic uncertain variable - real numbers within a set
Description::
In addition to continuous and discrete aleatory probability
distributions, %Dakota provides support for continuous and discrete
epistemic uncertainties through its continuous interval, discrete
interval, and discrete set specifications. 

Discrete variables may be used to represent things like epistemic model form
uncertainty, as mentioned above. For example, if one wants to analyze
the effect of model 1 vs. model 2 vs. model 3 in an epistemic analysis,
 one can use a discrete epistemic variable to represent the
uncertainty in the model form. There are three types of discrete
epistemic variables: 
\li a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value
within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4)
\li a discrete uncertain set of integers, in which the discrete value may
take any value within the integer set (for example, the set may be
defined as 1, 2, and 4)
\li a discrete uncertain set of reals, in
which the discrete variable may take any value defined within the real
set (for example, a parameter may have two allowable real values,
3.285 or 4.79). 

A random variable categorized as a discrete uncertain set of reals
is specified by pairs of \c set_values and \c set_probabilities.
While this may seem exactly like a histogram or probability 
density function (pdf), the difference is how the epistemic
methods treat the random variable.
