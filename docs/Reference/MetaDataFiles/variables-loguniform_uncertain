Aleatory uncertain variable - loguniform
Description::
If the logarithm of an uncertain variable X has a uniform distribution, that is 
\f$\log X \sim U(L_{LU},U_{LU})\f$, 
then X is distributed with a loguniform distribution. Within the loguniform uncertain optional group specification, the number of loguniform uncertain variables and the distribution lower and upper bounds are required specifications, and variable descriptors is an optional specification. 
The loguniform distribution has the density function:
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{x(ln U_{LU} - ln {L_{LU}})}\f]

Theory::
For vector and centered parameter studies, an inferred initial
starting point is needed for the uncertain variables.
These variables are initialized to their means for these studies.
