Method of feasible directions
Description::
The CONMIN library [\ref Van1973 "Vanderplaats, 1973"] is a public
domain library of nonlinear programming optimizers, specifically the
Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient (%Dakota's \c conmin_frcg method)
method for unconstrained optimization, and the method of feasible
directions (%Dakota's \c conmin_mfd method) for constrained
optimization. As CONMIN was a predecessor to the DOT commercial
library, the algorithm controls are very similar.  %Dakota provides
access to the CONMIN library through the CONMINOptimizer class.
