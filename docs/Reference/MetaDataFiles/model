Blurb::
Specifies how variables are mapped into a set of responses
Description::
A model is comprised of a mapping from variables, through an
interface, to responses.

<b> Model Group 1 </b>
The type of model can be:
-# \c single
-# \c nested
-# \c surrogate 

The input file must specify one of these types. If the type is not
specified, Dakota will assume a single model.

<b> Block Pointers and ID </b>

Each of these model types supports \c variables_pointer and \c
responses_pointer strings for identifying the variables and responses
specifications used in constructing the model by cross-referencing
with \c id_variables and \c id_responses strings from particular
variables and responses keyword specifications.

These pointers are valid for each model type since each model contains
a set of variables that is mapped into a set of responses -- only the
specifics of the mapping differ.

Additional pointers are used for each model type for
constructing the components of the variable to response mapping. As a
strategy specification identifies one or more methods and a method
specification identifies a model, a model specification identifies
variables, responses, and (for some types) interface specifications.
These are specific to a model type, and are therefore specified underneath
the relevant keyword.

Examples::
The next example displays a surrogate model specification which
selects a quadratic polynomial from among the global approximation
methods. It uses a pointer to a design of experiments method for
generating the data needed for building the global approximation, reuses
any old data available for the current approximation region, and
employs the first-order multiplicative approach to correcting the
approximation each time correction is requested.

\verbatim
model,
  id_model = 'M1'
  variables_pointer = 'V1'
  responses_pointer = 'R1'
  surrogate
    global
      polynomial quadratic
      dace_method_pointer = 'DACE'
      reuse_samples region
      correction multiplicative first_order
\endverbatim
This example demonstrates the use of identifiers and pointers. It
provides the optional model independent specifications for model
identifier, variables pointer, and responses pointer (see \ref
ModelIndControl) as well as model dependent specifications for 
global surrogates (see \ref ModelSurrG).

Finally, an advanced nested model example would be
\verbatim
model
	id_model = 'M1'
	variables_pointer = 'V1'
	responses_pointer = 'R1'
	nested
	 optional_interface_pointer = 'OI1'
	  optional_interface_responses_pointer = 'OIR1'
	 sub_method_pointer = 'SM1'
	  primary_variable_mapping  = '' '' 'X'   'Y'
	  secondary_variable_mapping = '' '' 'mean' 'mean'
	  primary_response_mapping  = 1. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0.
	  secondary_response_mapping = 0. 0. 0. 1. 3. 0. 0. 0. 0.
					 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 0. 1. 3. 0.
\endverbatim 
This example also supplies model independent controls for model
identifier, variables pointer, and responses pointer (see \ref
ModelIndControl), and supplies model dependent controls for specifying
details of the nested mapping (see \ref ModelNested).
