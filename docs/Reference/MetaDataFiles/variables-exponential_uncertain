Specify a random variable with a exponential distribution
Description::
The exponential distribution is often used for modeling failure rates. Within the exponential uncertain optional group specification, the number of exponential uncertain variables and the beta parameters are required specifications, and variable descriptors is an optional specification.
The density function for the exponential distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \frac{1}{\beta} e^{\frac{-x}{\beta}}\f] 
where 
\f$\mu_{E} = \beta\f$ and \f$\sigma^2_{E} = \beta^2\f$. 
Note that 
this distribution is a special case of the more general gamma distribution.
