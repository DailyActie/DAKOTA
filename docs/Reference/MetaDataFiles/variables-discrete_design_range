Specify discrete design variable using a range of integers
Description::
For discrete range variables, the \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds restrict the size of the feasible design space and are frequently used to prevent nonphysical designs. 
This is a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).
