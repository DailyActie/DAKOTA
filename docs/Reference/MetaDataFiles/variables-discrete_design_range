Discrete design variable - specified using a range of integers
Description::
For discrete range variables, the \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds restrict the size of the feasible design space and are frequently used to prevent nonphysical designs. 
This is a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).

Examples::
Theory::
Design variables are those variables which are modified for the
purposes of computing an optimal design.

Engineering design problems may contain discrete variables such as
material types, feature counts, stock gauge selections, etc. These
variables may assume only a fixed number of values.
