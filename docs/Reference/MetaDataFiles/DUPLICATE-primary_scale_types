Choose a scaling type for each response
Description::
The
\c primary_scale_types specification includes strings specifying the
scaling type for each response value in methods that support
scaling, when scaling is enabled. 
Each entry in \c primary_scale_types may be selected from
\c none, \c value, or \c log, to select no,
characteristic value, or logarithmic scaling, respectively. Automatic
scaling is not available for objective functions. If a single string
is specified it will apply to all responses
