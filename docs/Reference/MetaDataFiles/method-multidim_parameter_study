Parameter study
Description::
Dakota's multidimensional parameter study computes response data sets
for an n-dimensional grid of points. Each continuous and discrete
range variable is partitioned into equally spaced intervals between
its upper and lower bounds, each discrete set variable is partitioned
into equally spaced index intervals, and each combination of the
values defined by the boundaries of these partitions is evaluated.

This study is selected using the \c multidim_parameter_study method
specification followed by a \c partitions specification, where the \c
partitions list specifies the number of partitions for each
variable. The number of entries in the partitions list must be equal
to the total number of variables contained in the variables
specification.  As for the vector and centered studies, remainders
within the integer division of the step calculations are not permitted
for discrete range or set types and therefore no integer rounding
occurs, so the partitions specification must be carefully selected in
the presence of these types.  Since the initial values from the
variables specification will not be used, they need not be
specified.
