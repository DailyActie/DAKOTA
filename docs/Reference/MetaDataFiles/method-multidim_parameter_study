Parameter study - make a full factorial grid of study points
Description::
Dakota's multidimensional parameter study computes response data sets
for an n-dimensional grid of points. Each continuous and discrete
range variable is partitioned into equally spaced intervals between
its upper and lower bounds, each discrete set variable is partitioned
into equally spaced index intervals. The partition boundaries in 
n-dimensional space define a grid of points, and every point is 
evaluated.

Since the initial values from the
variables specification will not be used, they need not be
specified.
