Stopping criterion based on convergence of the objective function
Description::
The \c convergence_tolerance specification provides a real value for
controlling the termination of iteration. In most cases, it is a
relative convergence tolerance for the objective function; i.e., if
the change in the objective function between successive iterations
divided by the previous objective function is less than the amount
specified by convergence_tolerance, then this convergence criterion is
satisfied on the current iteration. Since no progress may be made on
one iteration followed by significant progress on a subsequent
iteration, some libraries require that the convergence tolerance be
satisfied on two or more consecutive iterations prior to termination
of iteration. This control is used with optimization and least squares
iterators (DOT, CONMIN, NPSOL, NLSSOL, OPT++, and SCOLIB) and is not
used within the uncertainty quantification, design of experiments, or
parameter study iterator branches. Refer to \ref MethodDOTIC, 
\ref MethodNPSOLIC, \ref MethodOPTPPIC, and \ref MethodSCOLIBIC for 
specific interpretations of the \c convergence_tolerance specification.
