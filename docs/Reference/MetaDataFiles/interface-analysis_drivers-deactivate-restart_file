Description::
\li Restart file: deactivation of this feature using a \c deactivate
\c restart_file specification allows the user to eliminate the output
of each new function evaluation to the binary restart file.  This can
increase speed and reduce disk storage requirements, but at the
expense of a loss in the ability to recover and continue a run that
terminates prematurely (e.g., due to a system crash or network
problem).  This option is not recommended when function evaluations
are costly or prone to failure. Please note that using the \c deactivate
\c restart_file specification will result in a zero length restart file 
with the default name \c dakota.rst.
