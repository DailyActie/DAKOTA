Hessians are needed and are available directly from the analysis driver
Description::
Hessian availability must be specified with either \c no_hessians, \c
numerical_hessians, \c quasi_hessians, \c analytic_hessians, or \c
mixed_hessians.

The \c analytic_hessians specification means that Hessian information
is available directly from the simulation. The simulation must return
the Hessian data in the %Dakota format (enclosed in double brackets; see
%Dakota File Data Formats in Users Manual 
[\ref UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"]) for the case of file transfer of 
data. The \c analytic_hessians keyword is a complete specification for 
this case.
