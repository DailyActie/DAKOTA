Pattern search, derivative free optimization method
Description::
The direct search algorithm, PDS
(parallel direct search method), supports
bound constraints.

The PDS method can directly
exploit asynchronous evaluations; however, this capability has not yet
been implemented in Dakota.

See \ref topic-package_optpp for info related to all \c optpp methods.
