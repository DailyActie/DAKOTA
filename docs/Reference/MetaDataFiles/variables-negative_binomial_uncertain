Aleatory uncertain discrete variable - negative binomial
Description::
The negative binomial distribution is typically used to predict the number of times to perform a test to have a total of \c n successes, where each test has a probability \c p of success. 
 
The density function for the negative binomial distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = \left(\begin{array}{c}{n+x-1}\\{x}\end{array}\right){p^n}{(1-p)^{x}}\f] 
where \c p is the probability of success per trial and \c n is the number of successful trials.
