Specify a random variable with a geometric distribution
Description::
The geometric distribution represents the number of successful trials that might occur before a failure is observed. 
 
The density function for the geometric distribution is given by: 
\f[f(x) = {p}{(1-p)^{x}}\f] 
where 
\c p 
is the probability of failure per trial.
