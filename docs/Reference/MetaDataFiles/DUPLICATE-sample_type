Choose the sampling algorithm
Description::
There are only two choices:
\li Monte Carlo (pure random)
\li Latin Hypercube Sampling

<b> For the \c sampling method only </b> - there is an option to augment an existing study with more
samples to get better estimates of mean, variance, and percentiles,
one can select \c incremental_random or \c incremental_lhs as the \c
sample_type. 

Note that a preliminary sample of size N must have
already been performed, and a \c dakota.rst restart file must be
available from this original sample. The incremental method must
match the original study method.

Note that the number of samples in the second
set MUST currently be 2 times the number of previous samples, although
incremental sampling based on any power of two may be supported in
future releases.

Examples::
For example, say a user performs
an initial study using \c lhs as the \c sample_type, and generates 50
samples. If the user creates a new input file where \c samples is now
specified to be 100, the \c sample_type is defined to be \c
incremental_lhs or \c incremental_random, and \c previous_samples is
specified to be 50, the user will get 50 new LHS samples which
maintain both the correlation and stratification of the original LHS
sample. The N new samples will be combined with the N original
samples to generate a combined sample of size 2N. The syntax for
running the second sample set is: \c dakota \c -i \c input2.in \c -r
\c dakota.rst, where \c input2.in is the file which specifies
incremental sampling.
