Choose the sampling algorithm
Description::
There are only two types of sampling:
\li Monte Carlo (pure random)
\li Latin Hypercube Sampling

However, some methods allow an existing study to be augmented with additional or incremental sampling.
This is used to get better estimates of mean, variance, and percentiles.
The incremental study must use the same type of sampling 
as the existing study.
