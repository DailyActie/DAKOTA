Blurb::
Tag each parameters & results file name with the function evaluation number
Description::
If this keyword is used, Dakota will append a period and the function evaluation
number to the names of the parameter and results files.

For examples, for the 3rd function evaluation:
\verbatim
  parameters_file = params.in
  results_file = results.out
  file_tag
\endverbatim
Dakota will write \c params.in.3, and will expect \c results.out.3 to be written by the analysis driver.

If this keyword is omitted, the default is no file tagging. 

File tagging is most useful when multiple
function evaluations are running simultaneously using files in a
shared disk space. The analysis driver will be able to
infer the function evaluation number from the file names.
