(Default) Specified file is in the annotated format
Description::
Annotated Matrix (default for all I/O; specified via 
{\tt annotated}): text file with one leading row of comments/column 
labels and one leading column of evaluation/row IDs surrounding 
num\_rows x num\_cols whitespace-separated numeric data, (newlines 
separating rows are not currently required, but may be in the 
future). The numeric data in a row may correspond to variables, 
variables followed by responses, data point for calibration, etc., 
depending on context. 

\b Attention: Prior to October 2011, calibration and surrogate data 
files were free-form format. They now default to annotated format, 
though {\c freeform} remains an option. For both formats, a warning 
will be generated if a specific number of data are expected, but extra 
is found and an error generated when there is insufficient data. Some 
TPLs like SCOLIB and JEGA manage their own file I/O and only support 
the free-form option.
