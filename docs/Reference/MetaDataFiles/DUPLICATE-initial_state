Initial values for the state variables
Description::
The \c initial_state specifications
provide the values for the state variables which will be
passed to the simulator.

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
When does this matter, and when does it not? I have no idea...
When does the method actually use this? when do state variables change? in that case, does the initial state matter? Does this have a default value?
!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
