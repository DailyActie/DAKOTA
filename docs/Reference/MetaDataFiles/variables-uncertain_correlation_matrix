Specify correlations between aleatory uncertain variables
Description::
Aleatory uncertain variables may have correlations specified through
use of an \c uncertain_correlation_matrix specification. This
specification is generalized in the sense that its specific meaning
depends on the nondeterministic method in use. When the method is a
nondeterministic sampling method (i.e., \c sampling), then the
correlation matrix specifies <i>rank correlations</i> 
[\ref Iman1982 "Iman and Conover, 1982"]. When the method is 
instead a reliability (i.e., \c local_reliability or \c
global_reliability) or stochastic expansion (i.e., \c
polynomial_chaos or \c stoch_collocation) method, then the
correlation matrix specifies <i>correlation coefficients</i>
(normalized covariance) [\ref Haldar2000 "Haldar and Mahadevan, 2000"].
In either of these cases, specifying the identity matrix results in
uncorrelated uncertain variables (the default). The matrix input
should be symmetric and have all \f$n^2\f$ entries where \e n is the
total number of aleatory uncertain variables (all normal, lognormal, 
uniform, loguniform, triangular, exponential, beta, gamma, gumbel,
frechet, weibull, histogram bin, poisson, binomial, negative binomial, 
geometric, hypergeometric, and histogram point specifications, in that 
order).
