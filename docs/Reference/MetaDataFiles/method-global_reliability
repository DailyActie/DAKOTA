Description::
Global reliability methods are selected using the \c
global_reliability specification and are implemented within the
NonDGlobalReliability class.  These methods do not support
forward/inverse mappings involving \c reliability_levels, since they
never form a reliability index based on distance in u-space.  Rather
they use a Gaussian process model to form an approximation to the
limit state (based either in x-space via the \c x_gaussian_process
specification or in u-space via the \c u_gaussian_process
specification), followed by probability estimation based on multimodal
adaptive importance sampling (see 
[\ref Bichon2007 "Bichon et al., 2007"]) and 
[\ref Bichon2008 "Bichon et al., 2008"]).  These
probability estimates may then be transformed into generalized
reliability levels if desired.  At this time, inverse reliability
analysis (mapping probability or generalized reliability levels into
response levels) is not implemented.  The Gaussian process model
approximation to the limit state is formed over the aleatory uncertain
variables by default, but may be extended to also capture the effect
of design, epistemic uncertain, and state variables.  If this is
desired, one must use the appropriate controls to specify the active
variables in the variables specification block. By default, the
Surfpack GP (Kriging) model is used, but the %Dakota implementation may
be selected instead. If \c use_derivatives is specified the GP model
will be built using available derivative data (Surfpack GP only).
