Description::
Multipoint approximations use data from previous design points to
improve the accuracy of local approximations.  Currently, the
Two-point Adaptive Nonlinearity %Approximation (TANA-3) method of
[\ref Xu1998 "Xu and Grandhi, 1998"] is supported. This method
requires response value and gradient information from two points, and
uses a first-order Taylor series if only one point is available.  The
truth model to be used to generate the value/gradient data used in the
approximation is identified through the required \c
actual_model_pointer specification.  \ref T6d7 "Table 6.7" summarizes
the multipoint approximation specifications.
