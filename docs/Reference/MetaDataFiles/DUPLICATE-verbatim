Change how Dakota launches the analysis driver
Description::
The parameters
and results file names are passed on the command line to the analysis

verbatim option is invoked, in which case the driver/filter invocation
syntax is used verbatim without command line argument augmentation.
For additional information on invocation syntax, see the Interfaces
chapter of the Users Manual [\ref UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"].
