Gradients will not be used.
Description::
The gradient specification must be one of four types: 1) no gradients,
2) numerical gradients, 3) analytic gradients, or 4) mixed gradients.

The \c no_gradients specification means that gradient information is
not needed in the study. Therefore, it will neither be retrieved from
the simulation nor computed with finite differences. The \c
no_gradients keyword is a complete specification for this case.
