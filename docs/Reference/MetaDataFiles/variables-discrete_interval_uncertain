Epistemic uncertain variable - integers within one or more intervals
Description::
The discrete interval uncertain variable is NOT a discrete random variable. It acts like a discrete version of \c variables-continuous_interval_uncertain.

Discrete uncertain variables may be used to represent things like epistemic model form
uncertainty. For example, if one wants to analyze
the effect of model 1 vs. model 2 vs. model 3 in an epistemic analysis
(either an interval analysis or a Dempster-Shafer evidence theory
analysis), one can use a discrete epistemic variable to represent the
uncertainty in the model form. 

A discrete interval variable that may take any integer value
within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).
