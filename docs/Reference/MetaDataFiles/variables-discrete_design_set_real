Discrete design variables - specified using lists of reals 
Description::
These variables are specified with: 1) a list of positive integers specifying how many set members there are, and 2) a list of permissable values.

Topics:: 	discrete_variables, design_variables
Examples:: Two continuous, restricted variables whose values will be selected during  the search for an optimal design. \f$y1 \in [0.25,1.25, 2.25, 3.25, 4.25]\f$, \f$y2 \in [0,5]\f$
\verbatim
discrete_design_set_real 2
        num_set_values 5 2
        set_values 0.25 1.25 2.25 3.25 4.25 0 5
        descriptors 'y1' 'y2'
\endverbatim

Theory::
Design variables are those variables which are modified for the
purposes of computing an optimal design.

Engineering design problems may contain discrete variables such as
material types, feature counts, stock gauge selections, etc. These
variables may assume only a fixed number of values.
