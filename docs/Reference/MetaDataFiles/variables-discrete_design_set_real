Discrete design variables - specified using lists of reals 
Description::
These variables are specified with: 1) a list of positive integers specifying how many set members there are, and 2) a list of permissable values.

Topics:: 	discrete_variables, design_variables, not_yet_reviewed
Examples::
Theory::
Design variables are those variables which are modified for the
purposes of computing an optimal design.

Engineering design problems may contain discrete variables such as
material types, feature counts, stock gauge selections, etc. These
variables may assume only a fixed number of values.
