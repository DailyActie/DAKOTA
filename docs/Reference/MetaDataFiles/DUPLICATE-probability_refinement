Description::
Allow refinement of probability and generalized reliability results using importance sampling


The \c probability_refinement specification
is identical to that of \ref MethodNonDLocalRel, with the
implementation difference that density reweighting must account for
additional non-Gaussian cases. This option allows for refinement of
probability and generalized reliability results using importance
sampling.
