Keep the parameters & results files after the analysis driver completes
Description::
If \c file_save is used, Dakota will not delete the parameters and
results files after the function evaluation is completed.

The default behavior is NOT to save these files.

File saving is most useful when debugging the
data communication between %Dakota and the simulation.
