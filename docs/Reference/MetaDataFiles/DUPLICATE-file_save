Keep the input/results files after the analysis driver completes
Description::
File
tagging (appending parameters and results files with the function
evaluation number) and file saving (leaving parameters and results
files in existence after their use is complete) are controlled with
the \c file_tag and \c file_save flags. If these specifications are
omitted, the default is no file tagging (no appended function
evaluation number) and no file saving (files will be removed after a
function evaluation). File tagging is most useful when multiple
function evaluations are running simultaneously using files in a
shared disk space, and file saving is most useful when debugging the
data communication between %Dakota and the simulation.
