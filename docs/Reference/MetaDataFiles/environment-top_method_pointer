Identify which method block will begin the Dakota study
Description::
An optional \c top_method_pointer specification may be used to point
to a particular method specification to begin iteration.
If \c top_method_pointer is not
used, then it will be inferred as decribed in \ref environment (no \c
top_method_pointer within an environment specification is treated the
same as no environment specification).
