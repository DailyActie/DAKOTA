Parameter study - points moving out from a center point
Description::
Dakota's centered parameter study computes response data sets along
multiple coordinate-based vectors, one per parameter, centered about
the initial values from the variables specification. This is useful
for investigation of function contours with respect to each parameter
individually in the vicinity of a specific point (e.g.,
post-optimality analysis for verification of a minimum), thereby
avoiding the cost associated with a multidimensional grid. 

In contrast to the \c vector_parameter_study, where steps
are taken along a vector, the \c centered_parameter_study
takes steps along each orthogonal dimension. Each dimension
is treated independently.

The number of steps are taken in each direction, so that the total number of points in the parameter study is \f[1+ 2\sum{n}  \f]
