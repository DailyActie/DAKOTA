Parameter study
Description::
Dakota's centered parameter study computes response data sets along
multiple coordinate-based vectors, one per parameter, centered about
the initial values from the variables specification. This is useful
for investigation of function contours with respect to each parameter
individually in the vicinity of a specific point (e.g.,
post-optimality analysis for verification of a minimum), thereby
avoiding the cost associated with a multidimensional grid. It is
selected using the \c centered_parameter_study method specification
followed by \c step_vector and \c steps_per_variable specifications.
The \c step_vector specification provides the size of the increments
for each variable (employed sequentially, not all at once as for \ref
MethodPSVPS) in either actual values (continuous and discrete range)
or index offsets (discrete set). The \c steps_per_variable
specification provides the number of increments per variable (again,
employed sequentially) in each of the plus and minus directions.
