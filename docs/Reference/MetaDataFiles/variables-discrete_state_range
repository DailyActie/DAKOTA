Discrete state variable defined by bounds
Description::
State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
tolerances, and time step controls. 
The \c initial_state specifications
provide the initial values for the state variables which will be
passed through to the simulator (e.g., in order to define
parameterized modeling controls). 

When would this ever be used?
