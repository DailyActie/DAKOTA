Blurb::
Uncertainty quantification based on random sampling of the variables
Description::
This method draws samples from the
specified uncertain variable probability distributions and propagates
them through the model to obtain statistics on the distributions of 
the responses. 

<b> Method Behavior </b>

The following keywords change how the samples are selected:
\li sample_type
\li fixed_seed
\li rng
\li samples
\li seed
\li variance_based_decomp

!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! Does variance_based_decomp change the samples?  if so, this is not mentioned at all.

<b> Method Outputs </b>

The keywords change the method outputs:
\li variance_based_decomp
\li reliability_levels
\li response_levels
\li distribution
\li probability_levels     
\li gen_reliability_levels 



As a default, %Dakota provides correlation analyses when running LHS.
Correlation tables are printed with the simple, partial, and rank
correlations between inputs and outputs. These can be useful to get a
quick sense of how correlated the inputs are to each other, and how
correlated various outputs are to inputs. 

<!---
Normally, \c sampling generates samples only for the 
uncertain variables, and
treats any design or state variables as constants. 
However, if \c active \c all is specified in the variables block, 
sampling will be performed over all variables, including 
uncertain, design, and state. 
In this case, the sampling 
algorithm will treat any continuous design or continuous state variables
as parameters with uniform probability distributions between their
upper and lower bounds. Samples are then generated over all of the
continuous variables (design, uncertain, and state) in the variables
specification. 

This is similar to the behavior of the design of
experiments methods, since they will also
generate samples over all continuous design, uncertain, and state
variables in the variables specification. 
However, the design of
experiments methods will treat all variables as being uniformly
distributed between their upper and lower bounds, whereas the \c
sampling method will sample the uncertain variables within
their specified probability distributions. 

If further 
granularity of sampling is necessary for uncertain variables, 
one can specify \c active \c epistemic or \c active \c aleatory 
to specify sampling over only epistemic uncertain or 
only aleatory uncertain variables, respectively. 
In the case where one wants to generate samples only over 
state variables, one would specify \c active \c state in the 
variables specification block.
