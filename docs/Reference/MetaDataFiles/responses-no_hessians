Hessians will not be used
Description::
Hessian availability must be specified with either \c no_hessians, \c
numerical_hessians, \c quasi_hessians, \c analytic_hessians, or \c
mixed_hessians.

The \c no_hessians specification means that the method does not
require %Dakota to manage the computation of any Hessian
information. Therefore, it will neither be retrieved from the
simulation nor computed by %Dakota. The \c no_hessians keyword is a
complete specification for this case.  Note that, in some cases,
Hessian information may still be being approximated internal to an
algorithm (e.g., within a quasi-Newton optimizer such as \c
optpp_q_newton); however, %Dakota has no direct involvement in this
process and the responses specification need not include it.
