Description::
The required \c analysis_drivers specification provides the names of
executable analysis programs or scripts, a.k.a. "drivers" which comprise a function
evaluation. 

<b> Use Cases </b>
A function evaluation is comprised of:
-# A single analysis driver
   Function evaluation is contained entirely within a single script/executable
   -* Supply the name of the executable or script
-# A single analysis driver with filters
   Function evaluation is split into a pre-processing, analysis, post-processing
-# A single analysis driver with environment variables
   Function evaluation is contained within one analysis driver, but it requires
   environment variables to be set before running
-# Multiple analysis drivers
   Drivers are run sequentially and can have any of the above options as well.
