Specify the list of points that the \c list_parameter_study will run
Description::
The number of real values in the \c list_of_points specification or
file referenced by \c import_points_file must be a multiple of the
total number of variables (including continuous and discrete types)
contained in the variables specification. This parameter study simply
performs simulations for the first parameter set (the first \c n
entries in the list), followed by the next parameter set (the next \c
n entries), and so on, until the list of points has been
exhausted. Since the initial values from the variables specification
will not be used, they need not be specified. For discrete set types,
the actual values should be specified, not the set indices, although
the values will be validated for membership within the set value
specifications.
