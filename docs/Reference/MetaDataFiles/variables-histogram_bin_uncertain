Aleatory uncertain variable - an aribtrary continuous random variable
Description::
Histogram uncertain variables are typically used to model a set of
empirical data. A bin histogram is a continuous aleatory distribution
that allows the user to specify bins of non-zero width (where the
uncertain variable may lie) along with the relative frequencies that
are associated with each bin. 

<!-- The distinction between the two types is that the former
specifies bins of non-zero width, whereas the latter specifies
individual point values, which can be thought of as bins with zero
width. In the terminology of LHS [\ref Wyss1998 "Wyss and Jorgensen,
1998"], the bin pairs specification defines a "continuous linear"
distribution and the point pairs specification defines a "discrete
histogram" distribution (although the points are real-valued, the
number of possible values is finite). -->

Within the histogram bin uncertain optional group specification, the
number of histogram bin uncertain variables is a required
specification, the number of pairs is an optional key for
apportionment of abscissas/ordinates/counts, specification of
abscissas and either ordinates or counts is required, and the variable
descriptors is an optional specification. When using a histogram bin
variable, one must define at least one bin (with two bounding value
pairs).

The \c abscissas specification define abscissa values ("x"
coordinates) for the probability density function of each histogram variable. When paired with
\c counts, the specifications provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each
histogram variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency or
relative probability) associated with a bin. If using bins of unequal
width and specification of probability densities is more natural, then
the \c counts specification can be replaced with a \c ordinates
specification ("y" coordinates) in order to support interpretation of
the input as \c (x,y) pairs defining the profile of a "skyline" probability density function.
Conversion between the two specifications is straightforward: a
count/frequency is a cumulative probability quantity defined from the
product of the ordinate density value and the \c x bin width. Thus,
in the cases of bins of equal width, ordinate and count specifications
are equivalent. In addition, ordinates and counts may be relative
values; it is not necessary to scale them as all user inputs will be
normalized.

To fully specify a bin-based histogram with \c n bins (potentially of
unequal width), \c n+1 \c (x,c) or \c (x,y) pairs must be specified
with the following features:

\li \c x is the parameter value for the left boundary of a 
 histogram bin and \c c is the corresponding count for that bin.
 Alternatively, \c y defines the ordinate density value for this 
 bin within a skyline probability density function. The right boundary of the bin is
 defined by the left boundary of the next pair.
\li the final pair specifies the right end of the last bin
 and must have a \c c or \c y value of zero.
\li the \c x values must be strictly increasing.
\li all \c c or \c y values must be positive, except for the last which 
 must be zero.
\li a minimum of two pairs must be specified for each bin-based histogram.

The number of pairs specifications provide for the
proper association of multiple sets of \c (x,c) or \c (x,y) pairs with
individual histogram variables. For example, in the following
specification

\verbatim
histogram_bin_uncertain = 2
 num_pairs = 3 4
 abscissas = 5 8 10 .1 .2 .3 .4
 counts = 17 21 0 12 24 12 0
\endverbatim

\c num_pairs associates the first 3 \c (x,c) pairs from \c
abscissas and \c counts \c ((5,17),(8,21),(10,0)) with one
bin-based histogram variable, where one bin is defined between 5 and 8
with a count of 17 and another bin is defined between 8 and 10 with a
count of 21. The following set of 4 \c (x,c) pairs \c
((.1,12),(.2,24),(.3,12),(.4,0)) defines a second bin-based histogram
variable containing three equal-width bins with counts 12, 24, and 12
(middle bin is twice as probable as the other two).
