Choose which forward mapping to compute at each response level
Description::
\c compute is used to select which forward mapping is calculated
at each response level.

CDF/CCDF probabilities are calculated for specified response levels
using a simple binning approach. 

CDF/CCDF reliabilities are calculated for specified response levels by
computing the number of sample standard deviations separating the
sample mean from the response level.
