Method of feasible directions
Description::
The DOT library 
[\ref Vrand1995 "Vanderplaats Research and Development, 1995"] 
contains nonlinear programming optimizers, specifically the
Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (%Dakota's \c dot_bfgs method) and
Fletcher-Reeves conjugate gradient (%Dakota's \c dot_frcg method)
methods for unconstrained optimization, and the modified method of
feasible directions (%Dakota's \c dot_mmfd method), sequential linear
programming (%Dakota's \c dot_slp method), and sequential quadratic
programming (%Dakota's \c dot_sqp method) methods for constrained
optimization. %Dakota provides access to the DOT library through the
DOTOptimizer class.
