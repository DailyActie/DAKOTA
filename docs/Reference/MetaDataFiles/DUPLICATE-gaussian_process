Use a Gaussian Process surrogate or emulator
Description::
This specifies the use of a Gaussian process emulator (also called 
surrogate or meta-model). The Gaussian process (GP) will be constructed using a 
limited number of expensive simulation runs. 

There are two alternative Gaussian 
processes currently available: one that is in the surrogate library called surfpack, 
and one that is in dakota. The surfpack GP is often more accurate but is slower to build.
