Label the responses
Description::
The optional response labels specification \c descriptors is a list of strings which will be printed in %Dakota output to identify the values for particular response functions. The default descriptor strings use a root string plus a numeric identifier. 
This root string is \c "obj_fn" for objective functions, \c "least_sq_term" for least squares terms, \c "response_fn" for generic response functions, \c "nln_ineq_con" for nonlinear inequality constraints, and \c "nln_eq_con" for nonlinear equality constraints.
