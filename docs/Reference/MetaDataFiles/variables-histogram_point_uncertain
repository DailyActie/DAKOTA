Aleatory uncertain discrete variable - arbitrary discrete (real-valued) random variable
Description::
As mentioned above, histogram uncertain variables are typically used
to model a set of empirical data.  A point histogram is a discrete
aleatory distribution that allows the user to specify a set of
real-valued points and associated frequency values.
<!-- In this case, the histogram's "bins" have zero width. -->
Point histograms are similar to \ref VarDDSRV and \ref VarDSSRV, but
differ in the inclusion of information on the relative probabilities
of observing the different values within the set.

Within the histogram point uncertain optional group specification, the
number of histogram point uncertain variables is a required
specification, the number of pairs is an optional key for
apportionment of abscissas and counts, the sets of abscissas and
counts are required, and the variable descriptors are optional. When
using a histogram point variable, one must define at least one set of
abscissa/count pairs.  As for \ref VarCAUV_Bin_Histogram, the \c
abscissas specifications define abscissa values ("x" coordinates) for
the PDF of each histogram variable.  When paired with \c counts, the
specifications provide sets of \c (x,c) pairs for each histogram
variable where \c c defines a count (i.e., a frequency or relative
probability) associated with a point.

To fully specify a point-based histogram with \c n points, \c n
\c (x,c) pairs (note that \c (x,c) and \c (x,y) are equivalent in this
case) must be specified with the following features:

\li \c x is the point value and \c c is the corresponding count 
    for that value.
\li the \c x values must be strictly increasing.
\li all \c c values must be positive.
\li a minimum of one pair must be specified for each point-based histogram.

The \c num_pairs specification provides for the proper association of
multiple sets of \c (x,c) or \c (x,y) pairs with individual histogram
variables.  For example, in the following specification,

\verbatim
histogram_point_uncertain = 2
  num_pairs =   2           3  
  abscissas = 3 4 100 200 300
  counts    = 1 1   1   2   1
\endverbatim

\c num_pairs associates the \c (x,c) pairs ((3,1),(4,1)) with one
point-based histogram variable (where the values 3 and 4 are equally
probable) and associates the \c (x,c) pairs ((100,1),(200,2),(300,1))
with a second point-based histogram variable (where the value 200 is
twice as probable as either 100 or 300).
