Specify the response values at which to estimate relevant statistics
Description::
The particular statistics depend on the method, and they include:
 -# Reliabilities
 -# CDF probabilities
 -# CCDF probabilities

CDF/CCDF probabilities are calculated for specified response levels
using a simple binning approach. 

CDF/CCDF reliabilities are calculated for specified response levels by
computing the number of sample standard deviations separating the
sample mean from the response level.
