Cubature using spare grids
Description::
multidimensional integration by the Smolyak sparse grid method
   (specified with \c sparse_grid_level and, optionally, \c
   dimension_preference). The underlying one-dimensional
   integration rules are the same as for the tensor-product
   quadrature case; however, the default rule selection is \c nested
   for sparse grids (Genz-Keister for normals/transformed normals
   and Gauss-Patterson for uniforms/transformed uniforms). This
   default can be overridden with an explicit \c non_nested
   specification (resulting in Gauss-Hermite for normals/transformed
   normals and Gauss-Legendre for uniforms/transformed uniforms).
   As for tensor quadrature, the \c dimension_preference
   specification enables the use of anisotropic sparse grids (refer
   to the PCE description in the User's Manual for the anisotropic
   index set constraint definition). Similar to anisotropic tensor
   grids, the dimension with greatest preference will have
   resolution at the full \c sparse_grid_level and all other
   dimension resolutions will be reduced in proportion to their
   reduced preference. For PCE with either isotropic or anisotropic
   sparse grids, a summation of tensor-product expansions is used,
   where each anisotropic tensor-product quadrature rule underlying
   the sparse grid construction results in its own anisotropic
   tensor-product expansion as described in case 1. These
   anisotropic tensor-product expansions are summed into a sparse
   PCE using the standard Smolyak summation (again, refer to the
   User's Manual for additional details). As for \c quadrature_order,
   the \c sparse_grid_level specification admits an array input for
   enabling specification of multiple grid resolutions used by certain
   advanced solution methodologies.
