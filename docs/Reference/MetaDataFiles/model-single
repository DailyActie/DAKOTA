A model with one of each block: variable, interface, and response
Description::
The single model is the simplest model type. It uses a single
interface instance (see Chapter~\ref{interfaces}) to map variables
(see Chapter~\ref{variables}) into responses (see
Chapter~\ref{responses}). There is no recursion in this case. Refer
to the Models chapter in the Dakota Reference Manual~\cite{RefMan} for
additional information on the single model specification.

In the \c single model case, a single interface is used to map the variables into responses. The optional \c interface_pointer specification identifies this interface by cross-referencing with the \c id_interface string input from a particular interface keyword specification.
