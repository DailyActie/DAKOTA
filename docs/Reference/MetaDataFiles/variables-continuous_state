Continuous state variables
Description::
State variables consist of "other" variables which are to be mapped through
the simulation interface, in that they are not to be used for design and
they are not modeled as being uncertain. State variables provide
a convenient mechanism for parameterizing additional model inputs which might
include solver convergence tolerances, time step controls or 
mesh fildelity parameters.

Only parameter studies and design of experiments methods will iterate
on state variables.  The \c initial_value is used as the only value
for the state variable for all other methods, unless \c active
\c state is invoked.

Continuous state variables are defined by an interval.
