State Variables
Description::
State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence tolerances, and time step controls. Types include continuous real, discrete range of integer values (contiguous integers), discrete set of integer values, and discrete set of real values. Within each optional state variables specification group, the number of variables is always required. 
The \c initial_state specifications provide the initial values for the state variables which will be passed through to the simulator (e.g., in order to define parameterized modeling controls). The remaining specifications are analagous to those for \ref VarDV.
