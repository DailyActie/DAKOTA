State Variables
Description::
The \c initial_state specifications provide the initial values for the state variables which will be passed through to the simulator (e.g., in order to define parameterized modeling controls). The remaining specifications are analagous to those for \ref VarDV.

Topics::	state_variable, continuous_variable, not_yet_reviewed
Examples::
Theory::
State variables provide a convenient mechanism for managing additional
model parameterizations such as mesh density, simulation convergence
tolerances, and time step controls.
