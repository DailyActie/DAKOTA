Use AMPL to define algebraic input-output mappings 
Description::
If desired, one can define algebraic input-output mappings using the
AMPL code [\ref Ampl2003 "Fourer et al., 2003"] and save these
mappings in 3 files: <tt>stub.nl</tt>, <tt>stub.col</tt>, and
<tt>stub.row</tt>, where <tt>stub</tt> is a particular root name
describing a particular problem.  These files names can be
communicated to %Dakota using the \c algebraic_mappings input.  This
string may either specify the <tt>stub.nl</tt> filename, or
alternatively, just the <tt>stub</tt> itself.


%Dakota then uses <tt>stub.col</tt> and <tt>stub.row</tt> to extract
the input and output identifier strings and employs the AMPL solver
library [\ref Gay1997 "Gay, 1997"] to process the DAG specification in
<tt>stub.nl</tt>.  The variable and objective function names declared
within AMPL should be a subset of the variable descriptors and
response descriptors used by %Dakota (see \ref VarCommands and \ref
RespLabels).  Ordering is not important, as %Dakota will reorder data
as needed.
