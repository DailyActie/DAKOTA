<b> Introduction to Dakota Keywords </b>

In %Dakota, the \e strategy creates and manages \e methods (a.k.a. iterators) and \e
models. A model, generally speaking, contains a set of \e variables,
an \e interface, and a set of \e responses. An iterator repeatedly
operates on the model to map the variables into responses using the
interface. 

Each of these six pieces (strategy, method, model,
variables, interface, and responses) are specified in separate blocks of
the input file, and as a whole, determine the study to be
performed during an execution of the %Dakota software. 

A %Dakota
execution is limited to a single strategy, which may invoke multiple
methods. Furthermore, each method may have its own model, consisting
of (generally speaking) its own variables, interface, and set of
responses. Thus, there may be multiple specifications of the method,
model, variables, interface, and responses sections.


<b> Keyword Pages </b>

Every Dakota keyword has its own page in this manual. The page describes:
- Whether the keyword takes <tt>ARGUMENTS</tt>, and the data type
  Additional notes about <tt>ARGUMENTS</tt> can be found here: \ref input_spec-overview-arguments.
- Whether it has an <tt>ALIAS</tt>
- Which additional keywords can be specified to change its behavior
- Which of these additional keywords are required or optional
- Additional information about how to use the keyword in an input file

<!----
It can be difficult to capture the complex
relationships that can occur when specifications are nested within
multiple groupings. 
For example, in the \c model block, the \c
actual_model_pointer specification is a required specification within
the \c multipoint and \c local required group specifications, which
are separated from each other and from other required group
specifications (\c global and \c hierarchical) by logical OR's. The
selection between the \c global, \c multipoint, \c local, or \c
hierarchical required groups is contained within another required
group specification (\c surrogate), which is separated from the \c
single and \c nested required group specifications by logical
OR's. Rather than unnecessarily proliferate the number of tables in
attempting to capture all of these inter-relationships, a balance is
sought, since some inter-relationships are more easily discussed in
the associated text. The general structure of the following sections
is to present the outermost specification groups first (e.g., \c single,
\c surrogate, or \c nested followed
by lower levels of group specifications (e.g., \c global, \c multipoint,
\c local, or \c hierarchical surrogates.
