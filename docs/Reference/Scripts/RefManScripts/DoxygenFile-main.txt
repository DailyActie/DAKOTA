\section main_welcome Welcome
The \b Dakota (<b>D</b>esign <b>A</b>nalysis <b>K</b>it for <b>O</b>ptimization and <b>T</b>erascale
<b>A</b>pplications) toolkit provides a flexible, extensible interface
between analysis codes and iteration methods.
<!-----
 %Dakota contains algorithms for:
\li optimization with gradient and nongradient-based
methods
\li uncertainty quantification with sampling, reliability,
stochastic expansion, and interval estimation methods
\li parameter estimation with nonlinear least squares methods
\li sensitivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter
study capabilities
\li Bayesian calibration approaches

These capabilities may be used on their own
or as components within advanced algorithms such as: 
\li surrogate-based optimization
\li mixed integer nonlinear programming
\li mixed aleatory-epistemic uncertainty quantification
\li or optimization under uncertainty

The Reference Manual focuses on documentation of the various input
commands for %Dakota. It follows closely the structure of
dakota.input.summary. For more information see: \ref input_spec.

For information on software structure, refer to the <a
href="../html-dev/index.html">Developers Manual</a>, and for a tour of
%Dakota features and capabilities, refer to the Users Manual [\ref
UsersMan "Adams et al., 2010"].
