This dir contains all the source required to build the reference manual.
Edits should occur here, but the manual should be built somewhere else, 
since the completed manual should not be in the svn repo.

####
Quick Instructions:
####
This dir is called $REFERENCE
cp $REFERENCE/Scripts/SetUpWorkingDir.sh Path/To/Build/Dir

cd Path/To/Build/Dir
# Make sure doxygen 1.8.4+ is on your path.
sh SetUpWorkingDir.sh $REFERENCE/

# wait 10~15 minutes
# the Ref Man should now be accessible on your local machine at
#   Path/To/Build/Dir/Doxygen/html/index.html


####
Directory Contents
####
This dir contains the Scripts dir - used to build the manual, as well as 5 
types of content

1 Input Spec Summary - describes relations between keywords (and more)
2 TopicTree - describes relations between topics
3 MetaDataFiles/ - contains files that describe each keyword
4 TopicMetadataFiles/ - contains files that describe every topic
5 DoxygenFiles/ - contains the doxygen "support" files, to help build the .dox file

All edits should occur on the above content. The scripts will link to this 
content and build the manual.


####
Script Details:
####
The setup script in the Scripts dir actually runs 5 steps:
1 Parse Input Spec Summary -> keyword spec files
2 Parse Topic tree and topic metadatafiles
3 Parse Keyword specs, Generate Keyword content, and keyword topics (complete 
  topic content files)
4 Take templates, topic and keyword content files and make a doxygen file
5 Build doxgyen files

Steps 1 and 3 are the time consuming parts. Fortunately, you don't need to 
run the entire sequence every time.
- New builds or if you have changed the input spec, run everything.
- Otherwise, just run the last four steps (only step 3 takes a significant 
  amount of time anyways)
-- Step 3 parallelism works very well, up to 6x or so before losing 
   efficiency (will depend on your system).
--- parallelism > # of cpus will not help, and will probably hurt.
--- Edit SetUpWorkingDir.sh, see where Working_KeywordContentFiles.sh is run 
    the 2nd argument is the parallelism/concurrecy


Step 0 - copy the setup script to the build dir
- is recommend so that you can edit the file outside the svn working dir
- will require recopying IF the setup script changes (Should be fairly 
  stable in the Sept-Oct '13 time frame).
