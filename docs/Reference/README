This dir contains all the source required to build the reference manual.
Edits should occur here, but the manual should be built somewhere else.

There is a setup script in the Scripts dir. To use:
Make a working dir,
Run the script, it will copy everything over, and create the doxygen file.

This is for the first time build, and takes 8~10 minutes.
Later builds don't need all the steps.
If you only change the keyword metadata, for example, it takes ~3 minutes to run the last two scripts.

The doxygen file requires 1.8.4 to work correctly.

You can optionally copy the setup script to the working dir. That is nice in case you want to use the script to rebuild the manual -you can comment out the steps you don't need.
