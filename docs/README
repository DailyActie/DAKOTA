Recommended Tools
-----------------
Last known good tool versions:
  doxygen-1.5.1
  tetex-3.0-33.8

Process
-------
To automatically build manuals (takes some time due to poor management
of dependencies), configure DAKOTA with --enable-docs and:

  cd Dakota/docs
  make doxygen-dev-ref # to only build html dev/ref
  make pdf             # to also build latex/pdf dev/ref/users
  make SAND-shell      # to also build SAND report versions of dev/ref/users
  
Alternately one may manually execute some steps, e.g.,

* Cleanup
    rm -rf html-dev html-ref latex-dev latex-ref man-dev man-ref

* Build doxygen, including resolving cross-references
    doxygen Doxyfile && doxygen Doxyfile-ref
    doxygen Doxyfile && doxygen Doxyfile-ref

* Optimize LaTeX for PDF generation: either 
    EXECUTE latex_modify.perl
  or  
    EDIT latex-ref/*.tex files as indicated in comments in refman.tex

* IF building PDF of developer's manual, need to mitigate buffer overrun
    cp /usr/share/texmf/web2c/texmf.cnf .
    EDIT local copy to have save_size = 10*save_size, for example
    export TEXMFCNF=`pwd`:$TEXMFCNF

* Build PDFs
    cd latex-dev  && make     && cd ..
    cd latex-ref  && make     && cd ..
    cd latex-user && make pdf && cd ..

* To generate SAND Report-valid print documents (from Dakota/docs);
  requires reference and developers PDFs to exist as well as these
  files in SANDreport, which must be on the TEXINPUTS PATH.

    pdflatex SAND-shell-dev
    pdflatex SAND-shell-ref
    pdflatex SAND-shell-users

"Full" versions of manuals
--------------------------
To build using
  SAND-full-users.tex
  header-ref-SAND-full.tex
  header-dev-SAND-full.tex
which offer an alternative to the shell with included PDF; likely
copy the .tex and the SNL style files to the manual directory and
pdflatex there (not presently used)
