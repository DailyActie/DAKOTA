\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractShared}{
The Dakota (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale
Applications) toolkit provides a flexible and extensible interface
between simulation codes and iterative analysis methods. Dakota 
contains algorithms for optimization with gradient and
nongradient-based methods; uncertainty quantification with sampling,
reliability, and stochastic expansion methods; parameter
estimation with nonlinear least squares methods; and
sensitivity/variance analysis with design of experiments and parameter
study methods. These capabilities may be used on their own or as
components within advanced strategies such as surrogate-based
optimization, mixed integer nonlinear programming, or optimization
under uncertainty. By employing object-oriented design to implement
abstractions of the key components required for iterative systems
analyses, the Dakota toolkit provides a flexible and extensible
problem-solving environment for design and performance analysis of
computational models on high performance computers.

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractDev}{
This report serves as a developers manual for the Dakota software and
describes the Dakota class hierarchies and their interrelationships.
It derives directly from annotation of the source code and provides
detailed class documentation, including all member functions and
attributes.  
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractRef}{
This report serves as a reference manual for the commands specification
for the Dakota software, providing input overviews, option descriptions,
and example specifications.
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractUsers}{
This report serves as a user's manual for the Dakota software and
provides capability overviews and procedures for software execution,
as well as a variety of example studies.
}

\newcommand{\DakotaAbstractTheory}{
This report serves as a theoretical manual for selected algorithms
implemented within the Dakota software.  It is not intended as a
comprehensive theoretical treatment, since a number of existing texts
cover general optimization theory, statistical analysis, and other
introductory topics.  Rather, this manual is intended to summarize a
set of Dakota-related research publications in the areas of
surrogate-based optimization, uncertainty quantification, and
optimization under uncertainty that provide the foundation for many 
of Dakota's iterative analysis capabilities.
