This page discusses discrete state, design, and uncertain variables
(which have \c discrete in their keyword name) as they have similar
specifications. These include:
-# Set of integers
-# Set of strings
-# Set of reals
-# Range(s)
and each is described below.

In addition, some uncertain variables, e.g., binomial, are discrete,
real-valued random variables specified using parameters. These are
described on their individual keyword pages.

<b> Sets </b>

Sets of integers, strings, and reals have similar specifications,
though different value types.

The variables are specified using three keywords:
- Variable declaration keyword - specifies the number of variables being defined
- \c num_set_values - a list of positive integers specifying how many members each variable contains
  - Length = # of variables
- \c set_values - a list of the permissable integer values in ALL sets, concatenated together.
  - Length = sum of \c num_set_values
  - The order is very important here.
  - The list is partitioned according to the values of \c num_set_values, and each partition is assigned to a variable.
- The ordering of \c num_set_values, and the partitions of \c set_values must match the strings from \c descriptions

For string variables, each string element value must be quoted and may
contain alphanumeric, dash, underscore, and colon. White space, quote
characters, and backslash/metacharacters are not permitted.

Examples are given on the pages:
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set-integer
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set-string
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set-real 
- \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-integer
- \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set-real


<b> Range </b>

For discrete variables defined by range(s), the \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds restrict the permisible values.
For design variables, this constrains the feasible design space and is frequently used to prevent nonphysical designs. 
This is a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).
For some variable types, each variable is can be defined by multiple ranges.
