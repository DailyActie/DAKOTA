This page discusses discrete state, design, and uncertain variables. 

Variables with the word \c discrete in their name are all
specified in similar ways. These include:
-# Set of integers
-# Set of reals
-# Range(s)
and each of these is described below.

In addition, some uncertain variables are discrete, real-valued
random variables and are specified using parameters. These
are described on their individual keyword pages.



<b> Sets </b>

Sets of integers and reals are the same, except
that one of them is restricted to integer values.

The variables are specified using three keywords:
- Variable declaration keyword - specifies the number of variables being defined
- \c num_set_values - a list of positive integers specifying how many members each variable contains
  - Length = # of variables
- \c set_values - a list of the permissable integer values in ALL sets, concatenated together.
  - Length = sum of \c num_set_values
  - The order is very important here.
  - The list is partitioned according to the values of \c num_set_values, and each partition is assigned to a variable.
- The ordering of \c num_set_values, and the partitions of \c set_values must match the strings from \c descriptions

Examples are given on the pages:
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set_integer
- \ref variables-discrete_design_set_real 
- \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set_integer
- \ref variables-discrete_uncertain_set_real

<b> Range </b>

For discrete variables defined by range(s), the \c lower_bounds and \c upper_bounds restrict the permisible values.
For design variables, this constrains the feasible design space and is frequently used to prevent nonphysical designs. 
This is a discrete interval variable that may take any integer value within bounds (e.g., [1, 4], allowing values of 1, 2, 3, or 4).
For some variable types, each variable is can be defined by multiple ranges.
