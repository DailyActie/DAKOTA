\chapter{Output from Dakota}\label{output}

\section{Overview of Output Formats}\label{output:overview}

While Dakota primarily targets complex numerical simulation codes run
on massively parallel supercomputers, Dakota's output aims to provide
a succinct, text-based reporting of the progress of the iterations and
function evaluations performed by an algorithm. In addition, Dakota
provides a tabular output format that is useful for data visualization
with external tools and a basic graphical output capability that is
useful as a monitoring tool. The JAGUAR Dakota GUI is an emerging
capability that will provide more advanced visualization facilities in
time.  Dakota also has a number of export capabilities described in
the latter part of this chapter.

\section{Standard Output}\label{output:standard}

Dakota outputs basic information to standard out (screen, terminal,
or console) for each function evaluation, consisting of an evaluation
number, parameter values, execution syntax, the active set vector, and
the response data set. To describe the standard output of Dakota,
optimization of the ``container'' problem (see
Chapter~\ref{additional} for problem formulation) is used as an
example. The input file for this example is shown in
Figure~\ref{output:incont}. In this example, there is one equality
constraint, and Dakota's finite difference algorithm is used to
provide central difference numerical gradients to the NPSOL optimizer.

\end{small}

The output begins with information on the Dakota version, compilation
date, and run mode.  It then echos the user input file before
proceeding to execution phase.  The lines following ``\texttt{>>>>>
  Running npsol\_sqp iterator.}''  show Dakota performing function
evaluations 1--5 that have been requested by NPSOL. Evaluations 6
through 39 have been omitted from the listing for brevity.

Immediately following the line ``\texttt{Begin Function Evaluation
  1}'', the initial values of the design variables, the syntax of the
blocking fork function evaluation, and the resulting objective and
constraint function values returned by the simulation are listed.  The
values of the design variables are labeled with the tags \texttt{H}
and \texttt{D}, respectively, according to the descriptors given in
the input file, Figure~\ref{output:incont}.  The values of the
objective function and volume constraint are labeled with the tags
\texttt{obj\_fn} and \texttt{nln\_eq\_con\_1}, respectively. Note that
the initial design parameters are infeasible since the equality
constraint is violated ($\ne 0$). However, by the end of the run, the
optimizer finds a design that is both feasible and optimal for this
example. Between the design variables and response values, the content
of the system call to the simulator is displayed as
``\texttt{(container container.in.1 container.out.1)}'', with
\texttt{container} being the name of the simulator and
\texttt{container.in.1} and \texttt{container.out.1} being the names
of the parameters and results files, respectively.

Just preceding the output of the objective and constraint function
values is the line ``\texttt{Active set vector = \{1 1\}}''. The
active set vector indicates the types of data that are required from
the simulator for the objective and constraint functions, and values
of ``\texttt{1}'' indicate that the simulator must return values for
these functions (gradient and Hessian data are not required). For more
information on the active set vector, see Section~\ref{variables:asv}.

Since finite difference gradients have been specified, Dakota computes
their values by making additional function evaluation requests to the
simulator at perturbed parameter values. Examples of the
gradient-related function evaluations have been included in the sample
output, beginning with the line that reads ``\texttt{>>>>> Dakota
  finite difference evaluation for x[1] + h:}''. The resulting finite
difference gradients are listed after function evaluation 5 beginning
with the line ``\texttt{>>>>> Total response returned to iterator:}''.
Here, another active set vector is displayed in the Dakota output
file. The line ``\texttt{Active set vector = \{ 3 3 \}}'' indicates
that the total response resulting from the finite differencing
contains function values and gradients.

The final lines of the Dakota output, beginning with the line
``\texttt{<<<<< Function evaluation summary:}'', summarize the
results of the optimization study. The best values of the optimization
parameters, objective function, and volume constraint are presented
along with the function evaluation number where they occurred, total
function evaluation counts, and a timing summary. In the end, the
objective function has been minimized and the equality constraint has
been satisfied (driven to zero within the constraint tolerance).

The Dakota results may be intermixed with iteration information from
the NPSOL library. For example lines with the heading ``\texttt{Majr
  Minr Step Fun Merit function Norm gZ Violtn nZ Penalty Conv}'' come
from Fortran write statements within NPSOL. The output is mixed since
both Dakota and NPSOL are writing to the same standard output
stream. The relative locations of these output contributions can vary
depending on the specifics of output buffering and flushing on a
particular platform and depending on whether or not the standard
output is being redirected to a file. In some cases, output from the
optimization library may appear on each iteration (as in this
example), and in other cases, it may appear at the end of the Dakota
output. Finally, a more detailed summary of the NPSOL iterations is
written to the Fortran device 9 file (e.g., \texttt{fort.9} or
\texttt{ftn09}).

\section{Tabular Output Data}\label{output:tabular}

Dakota has the capability to print the iteration history in tabular
form to a file. The keyword\\
\texttt{tabular\_graphics\_data} needs to be included in the
environment specification (see Figure~\ref{output:incont}). The
primary intent of this capability is to facilitate the transfer of
Dakota's iteration history data to an external mathematical analysis
and/or graphics plotting package (e.g., MATLAB, TECplot, Excel,
S-plus, Minitab). Any evaluations from Dakota's internal finite
differencing are suppressed, to facilitate rapid plotting of the most
critical data.  This suppression of lower level data is consistent
with the data that is sent to the graphics windows, as described in
Section~\ref{output:graphics}. If this data suppression is
undesirable, Section~\ref{restart:utility:tabular} describes an
approach where every function evaluation, even the ones from finite
differencing, can be saved to a file in tabular format.

The default file name for the tabular output data is
``\texttt{dakota\_tabular.dat}'' and the output from the ``container''
optimization problem is shown in Figure~\ref{output:tabcont}. This
annotated tabular format (see Section~\ref{input:tabularformat}) file
contains the complete history of data requests from NPSOL (8 requests
map into a total of 40 function evaluations when including the central
finite differencing). The first column is the data request number, the
second and third columns are the design parameter values (labeled in
the example as ``\texttt{H}'' and ``\texttt{D}''), the fourth column
is the objective function (labeled ``\texttt{obj\_fn}''), and the
fifth column is the nonlinear equality constraint (labeled
``\texttt{nln\_eq\_con\_1}'').

\end{figure}

\section{Graphics Output}\label{output:graphics}

Graphics capabilities are available for monitoring the progress of an
iterative study. The graphics option is invoked by adding the
\texttt{graphics} flag in the environment specification of the Dakota
input file (see Figure~\ref{output:incont}). The graphics display
the values of each response function (e.g., objective and constraint
functions) and each parameter for the function evaluations in the
study. As for the tabular output described in
Section~\ref{output:tabular}, internal finite difference evaluations
are suppressed in order to omit this clutter from the graphics.
Figure~\ref{output:2dcont} shows the optimization iteration history
for the container example.

If Dakota is executed on a remote machine, the DISPLAY variable in the
user's UNIX environment~\cite{Gil92} may need to be set to the local
machine in order to display the graphics window. 

\begin{figure}
\centering
\includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{images/container_graphic}
\caption{Dakota 2D graphics for ``container'' problem showing history of
an objective function, an equality constraint, and two variables.}
\label{output:2dcont}
\end{figure}

The scroll bars which are located on each graph below and to the right
of each plot may be operated by dragging on the bars or pressing the
arrows, both of which result in expansion/contraction of the axis
scale. Clicking on the ``Options'' button results in the window shown
in Figure~\ref{output:2dcontoptions}, which allows the user to include
min/max markers on the vertical axis, vertical and horizontal axis
labels, and a plot legend within the corresponding graphics plot.  In
addition, the values of either or both axes may be plotted using a
logarithmic scale (so long as all plot values are greater than zero)
and an encapsulated postscript (EPS) file, named 
\texttt{dakota\_graphic\_\emph{i}.eps} where \emph{i} is the plot 
window number, can be created using the ``Print'' button.

\end{figure}


\section{Error Messages Output}\label{output:error}

A variety of error messages are printed by Dakota in the event that an
error is detected in the input specification. Some of the more common
input errors, and the associated error messages, are described below.
See also the Common Specification Mistakes section in the Dakota
Reference Manual~\cite{RefMan}.

Incorrectly spelled specifications, such as 
\texttt{``numericl\_gradients''}, will result in error messages of the form:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'numericl_gradients'.
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'method_source'.
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'dakota'.
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'interval_type'.
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'central'.
Input line 31: unrecognized identifier 'fd_gradient_step_size'.
Input line 31: One of the following 4 entities
must be specified for responses...
	analytic_gradients
	mixed_gradients
	no_gradients
	numerical_gradients
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
In this example the line numbers given are approximate, as all input
following an errant keywords is considered a single line through the
end of the block.

The input parser catches syntax errors, but not logic errors. The fact
that certain input combinations are erroneous must be detected after
parsing, at object construction time. For example, if a
\texttt{no\_gradients} specification for a response data set is
combined with selection of a gradient-based optimization method, then
this error must be detected during set-up of the optimizer (see last
line of listing):
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
Error: gradient-based minimizers require a gradient specification.
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
Many such errors can be detected earlier by running \texttt{dakota
  -check}.

Another common mistake involves a mismatch between the amount of data
expected on a function evaluation and the data returned by the user's
simulation code or driver. The available response data is specified in
the responses keyword block, and the subset of this data needed for a
particular evaluation is managed by the active set vector. For
example, if Dakota expects function values and gradients to be
returned (as indicated by an active set vector containing 3's), but
the user's simulation code only returns function values, then the
following error message is generated:
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    At EOF: insufficient data for functionGradient 1
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}

Unfortunately, descriptive error messages are not available for all
possible failure modes of Dakota. If you encounter core dumps,
segmentation faults, or other failures, please request help using the
support mechanisms described on the
\href{http://dakota.sandia.gov/}{Dakota website}.


\section{PCE coefficient export}\label{sec:output:pce}

Polynomial chaos expansion (PCE) methods compute coefficients for
response expansions which employ a basis of multivariate orthogonal
polynomials.  The \texttt{polynomial\_chaos} method calculates these
coefficients based on a number of approaches described in
Section~\ref{uq:expansion}).  One may output the PCE coefficients to a
file using the keyword \texttt{export\_expansion\_file =
  \emph{STRING}}.  Each row of the exported file will contain a
coefficient, followed by the multi-index indicating which basis terms
correspond to it.

\section{Surrogate Model Exports}

A number of Dakota surrogate models, including some stochastic
expansion approaches support the keyword \texttt{export\_points\_file
  = \emph{STRING}}.  When specified, any approximate evaluations
performed on the surrogate model will be output to the specified data
file.  This facilitates plotting or external diagnostics of the
surrogate model.

In addition the Surfpak family of global surrogate models supports
export (serialization) of surrogate models to text ({\tt .sps}) or
binary ({\tt .bsps}) model files.  These files are not human readable
(and don't contain an explicit algebraic form of the response surface
model).  Instead they may be imported into the {\tt surfpack}
executable or library API for evaluation, bypassing the reconstruction
of the surrogate model from build data.

\section{Variables Output from Pre-run}

The pre-run mode (supported only for select methods) permits
specification of an output file to which Dakota will write parameter
(variables) data in annotated format (see
Section~\ref{input:tabularformat}) with data columns corresponding to
each variable.  This file can be generated with sampling, parameter
study, and DACE methods by invoking
\begin{small}
\begin{verbatim}
    dakota -i dakota.in -pre_run ::variables.dat
\end{verbatim}
\end{small}
for example, to output the variables (samples) in an LHS study.
