The DAKOTA (Design Analysis Kit for Optimization and Terascale
Applications) project started in 1994 as an internal research and
development activity at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque,
New Mexico. The original goal was to provide a common set of
optimization tools for a group of engineers solving structural
analysis and design problems. Prior to the DAKOTA project, there was
no focused effort to archive optimization methods for reuse on other
projects. Thus, engineers found themselves repeatedly building new
custom interfaces between the engineering analysis software and
optimization software. This was especially burdensome when using
parallel computing, as each project developed a unique master program
to coordinate concurrent simulations on a network of workstations or a
parallel computer. The initial DAKOTA toolkit provided the engineering
and analysis community at Sandia access to a variety of optimization
algorithms, hiding the complexity of the optimization software
interfaces from the users. Engineers could readily switch between
optimization software packages by simply changing a few lines in a
DAKOTA input file. In addition to structural analysis, DAKOTA has been
applied to computational fluid dynamics, nonlinear dynamics, shock
physics, heat transfer, electrical circuits, and many other science
and engineering models.

DAKOTA has grown significantly beyond an optimization toolkit.  In
addition to its state-of-the-art optimization methods, DAKOTA includes
methods for global sensitivity and variance analysis, parameter
estimation, uncertainty quantification, and verification, as well as
meta-level strategies for surrogate-based optimization, mixed-integer
nonlinear programming, hybrid optimization, and optimization under
uncertainty. Available to all these algorithms is parallel computation
support; ranging from desktop multiprocessor computers to massively
parallel computers typically found at national laboratories and
supercomputer centers.
